Chapter 1

When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.

When it healed, and Jems fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, hewas seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than hisright; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, histhumb parallel to his thigh. He couldnt have cared less, so long as he could pass andpunt.

When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimesdiscussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, butJem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began thesummer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley comeout.

I said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing, it really began with AndrewJackson. If General Jackson hadnt run the Creeks up the creek, Simon Finch wouldnever have paddled up the Alabama, and where would we be if he hadnt? We were fartoo old to settle an argument with a fist-fight, so we consulted Atticus. Our father said wewere both right.

Being Southerners, it was a source of shame to some members of the family that wehad no recorded ancestors on either side of the Battle of Hastings. All we had wasSimon Finch, a fur-trapping apothecary from Cornwall whose piety was exceeded onlyby his stinginess. In England, Simon was irritated by the persecution of those who calledthemselves Methodists at the hands of their more liberal brethren, and as Simon calledhimself a Methodist, he worked his way across the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence toJamaica, thence to Mobile, and up the Saint Stephens. Mindful of John Wesleysstrictures on the use of many words in buying and selling, Simon made a pile practicingmedicine, but in this pursuit he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what heknew was not for the glory of God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel. SoSimon, having forgotten his teachers dictum on the possession of human chattels,bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead on the banks of theAlabama River some forty miles above Saint Stephens. He returned to Saint Stephensonly once, to find a wife, and with her established a line that ran high to daughters.

Simon lived to an impressive age and died rich.

It was customary for the men in the family to remain on Simons homestead, FinchsLanding, and make their living from cotton. The place was self-sufficient: modest incomparison with the empires around it, the Landing nevertheless produced everythingrequired to sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles of clothing, supplied by river-boats from Mobile.

Simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the North andthe South, as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land, yet the traditionof living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth century, when myfather, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his younger brother went toBoston to study medicine. Their sister Alexandra was the Finch who remained at theLanding: she married a taciturn man who spent most of his time lying in a hammock bythe river wondering if his trot-lines were full.

When my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and began hispractice. Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finchs Landing, was the county seat ofMaycomb County. Atticuss office in the courthouse contained little more than a hat rack,a spittoon, a checkerboard and an unsullied Code of Alabama. His first two clients werethe last two persons hanged in the Maycomb County jail. Atticus had urged them toaccept the states generosity in allowing them to plead Guilty to second-degree murderand escape with their lives, but they were Haverfords, in Maycomb County a namesynonymous with jackass. The Haverfords had dispatched Maycombs leadingblacksmith in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare,were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three witnesses, and insisted that the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it-coming-to-him was a good enough defense for anybody. Theypersisted in pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing muchAtticus could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion thatwas probably the beginning of my fathers profound distaste for the practice of criminallaw.

During his first five years in Maycomb, Atticus practiced economy more than anything;for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brothers education. JohnHale Finch was ten years younger than my father, and chose to study medicine at atime when cotton was not worth growing; but after getting Uncle Jack started, Atticusderived a reasonable income from the law. He liked Maycomb, he was MaycombCounty born and bred; he knew his people, they knew him, and because of SimonFinchs industry, Atticus was related by blood or marriage to nearly every family in thetown.

Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainyweather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthousesagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summersday; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the liveoaks on the square. Mens stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathedbefore noon, after their three-oclock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes withfrostings of sweat and sweet talcum.

People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of thestores around it, took their time about everything. A day was twenty-four hours long butseemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and nomoney to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County. But itwas a time of vague optimism for some of the people: Maycomb County had recentlybeen told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself.

We lived on the main residential street in townAtticus, Jem and I, plus Calpurnia ourcook. Jem and I found our father satisfactory: he played with us, read to us, and treatedus with courteous detachment.

Calpurnia was something else again. She was all angles and bones; she wasnearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard. She wasalways ordering me out of the kitchen, asking me why I couldnt behave as well as Jemwhen she knew he was older, and calling me home when I wasnt ready to come. Ourbattles were epic and one-sided. Calpurnia always won, mainly because Atticus alwaystook her side. She had been with us ever since Jem was born, and I had felt hertyrannical presence as long as I could remember.

Our mother died when I was two, so I never felt her absence. She was a Graham fromMontgomery; Atticus met her when he was first elected to the state legislature. He wasmiddle-aged then, she was fifteen years his junior. Jem was the product of their firstyear of marriage; four years later I was born, and two years later our mother died from asudden heart attack. They said it ran in her family. I did not miss her, but I think Jem did.

He remembered her clearly, and sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh atlength, then go off and play by himself behind the car-house. When he was like that, Iknew better than to bother him.

When I was almost six and Jem was nearly ten, our summertime boundaries (withincalling distance of Calpurnia) were Mrs. Henry Lafayette Duboses house two doors tothe north of us, and the Radley Place three doors to the south. We were never temptedto break them. The Radley Place was inhabited by an unknown entity the meredescription of whom was enough to make us behave for days on end; Mrs. Dubose wasplain hell.

That was the summer Dill came to us.

Early one morning as we were beginning our days play in the back yard, Jem and Iheard something next door in Miss Rachel Haverfords collard patch. We went to thewire fence to see if there was a puppyMiss Rachels rat terrier was expectinginstead we found someone sitting looking at us. Sitting down, he wasnt much higherthan the collards. We stared at him until he spoke:

Hey.

Hey yourself, said Jem pleasantly.

Im Charles Baker Harris, he said. I can read.

So what? I said.

I just thought youd like to know I can read. You got anything needs readin I can doit

How old are you, asked Jem, four-and-a-half?

Goin on seven.

Shoot no wonder, then, said Jem, jerking his thumb at me. Scout yonders beenreadin ever since she was born, and she aint even started to school yet. You look rightpuny for goin on seven.

Im little but Im old, he said.

Jem brushed his hair back to get a better look. Why dont you come over, CharlesBaker Harris? he said. Lord, what a name.

s not any funniern yours. Aunt Rachel says your names Jeremy Atticus Finch.

Jem scowled. Im big enough to fit mine, he said. Your names longern you are. Betits a foot longer.

Folks call me Dill, said Dill, struggling under the fence.

Do better if you go over it instead of under it, I said. Whered you come from?

Dill was from Meridian, Mississippi, was spending the summer with his aunt, MissRachel, and would be spending every summer in Maycomb from now on. His family wasfrom Maycomb County originally, his mother worked for a photographer in Meridian, hadentered his picture in a Beautiful Child contest and won five dollars. She gave themoney to Dill, who went to the picture show twenty times on it.

Dont have any picture shows here, except Jesus ones in the courthouse sometimes,

said Jem. Ever see anything good?

Dill had seen Dracula, a revelation that moved Jem to eye him with the beginning ofrespect. Tell it to us, he said.

Dill was a curiosity. He wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt, his hair wassnow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff; he was a year my senior but I toweredover him. As he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and darken; his laughwas sudden and happy; he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the center of his forehead.

When Dill reduced Dracula to dust, and Jem said the show sounded better than thebook, I asked Dill where his father was: You aint said anything about him.

I havent got one.

Is he dead?

No

Then if hes not dead youve got one, havent you?

Dill blushed and Jem told me to hush, a sure sign that Dill had been studied and foundacceptable. Thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment. Routine contentmentwas: improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin chinaberry trees in theback yard, fussing, running through our list of dramas based on the works of OliverOptic, Victor Appleton, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. In this matter we were lucky to haveDill. He played the character parts formerly thrust upon methe ape in Tarzan, Mr.

Crabtree in The Rover Boys, Mr. Damon in Tom Swift. Thus we came to know Dill as apocket Merlin, whose head teemed with eccentric plans, strange longings, and quaintfancies.

But by the end of August our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions, and itwas then that Dill gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.

The Radley Place fascinated Dill. In spite of our warnings and explanations it drew himas the moon draws water, but drew him no nearer than the light-pole on the corner, asafe distance from the Radley gate. There he would stand, his arm around the fat pole,staring and wondering.

The Radley Place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house. Walking south, onefaced its porch; the sidewalk turned and ran beside the lot. The house was low, wasonce white with a deep front porch and green shutters, but had long ago darkened to thecolor of the slate-gray yard around it. Rain-rotted shingles drooped over the eaves of theveranda; oak trees kept the sun away. The remains of a picket drunkenly guarded thefront yarda swept yard that was never sweptwhere johnson grass and rabbit-tobacco grew in abundance.

Inside the house lived a malevolent phantom. People said he existed, but Jem and Ihad never seen him. People said he went out at night when the moon was down, andpeeped in windows. When peoples azaleas froze in a cold snap, it was because he hadbreathed on them. Any stealthy small crimes committed in Maycomb were his work.

Once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid nocturnal events: peoples chickensand household pets were found mutilated; although the culprit was Crazy Addie, whoeventually drowned himself in Barkers Eddy, people still looked at the Radley Place,unwilling to discard their initial suspicions. A Negro would not pass the Radley Place atnight, he would cut across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked. TheMaycomb school grounds adjoined the back of the Radley lot; from the Radleychickenyard tall pecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard, but the nuts layuntouched by the children: Radley pecans would kill you. A baseball hit into the Radleyyard was a lost ball and no questions asked.

The misery of that house began many years before Jem and I were born. TheRadleys, welcome anywhere in town, kept to themselves, a predilection unforgivable inMaycomb. They did not go to church, Maycombs principal recreation, but worshiped athome; Mrs. Radley seldom if ever crossed the street for a mid-morning coffee break withher neighbors, and certainly never joined a missionary circle. Mr. Radley walked to townat eleven-thirty every morning and came back promptly at twelve, sometimes carrying abrown paper bag that the neighborhood assumed contained the family groceries. I neverknew how old Mr. Radley made his livingJem said he bought cotton, a polite term fordoing nothingbut Mr. Radley and his wife had lived there with their two sons as longas anybody could remember.

The shutters and doors of the Radley house were closed on Sundays, another thingalien to Maycombs ways: closed doors meant illness and cold weather only. Of all daysSunday was the day for formal afternoon visiting: ladies wore corsets, men wore coats,children wore shoes. But to climb the Radley front steps and call, He-y, of a Sundayafternoon was something their neighbors never did. The Radley house had no screendoors. I once asked Atticus if it ever had any; Atticus said yes, but before I was born.

According to neighborhood legend, when the younger Radley boy was in his teens hebecame acquainted with some of the Cunninghams from Old Sarum, an enormous andconfusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county, and they formed the nearestthing to a gang ever seen in Maycomb. They did little, but enough to be discussed bythe town and publicly warned from three pulpits: they hung around the barbershop; theyrode the bus to Abbottsville on Sundays and went to the picture show; they attendeddances at the countys riverside gambling hell, the Dew-Drop Inn & Fishing Camp; theyexperimented with stumphole whiskey. Nobody in Maycomb had nerve enough to tellMr. Radley that his boy was in with the wrong crowd.

One night, in an excessive spurt of high spirits, the boys backed around the square ina borrowed flivver, resisted arrest by Maycombs ancient beadle, Mr. Conner, andlocked him in the courthouse outhouse. The town decided something had to be done;Mr. Conner said he knew who each and every one of them was, and he was bound anddetermined they wouldnt get away with it, so the boys came before the probate judgeon charges of disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, assault and battery, and usingabusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female. The judgeasked Mr. Conner why he included the last charge; Mr. Conner said they cussed so loudhe was sure every lady in Maycomb heard them. The judge decided to send the boys tothe state industrial school, where boys were sometimes sent for no other reason than toprovide them with food and decent shelter: it was no prison and it was no disgrace. Mr.

Radley thought it was. If the judge released Arthur, Mr. Radley would see to it thatArthur gave no further trouble. Knowing that Mr. Radleys word was his bond, the judgewas glad to do so.

The other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondaryeducation to be had in the state; one of them eventually worked his way throughengineering school at Auburn. The doors of the Radley house were closed on weekdaysas well as Sundays, and Mr. Radleys boy was not seen again for fifteen years.

But there came a day, barely within Jems memory, when Boo Radley was heard fromand was seen by several people, but not by Jem. He said Atticus never talked muchabout the Radleys: when Jem would question him Atticuss only answer was for him tomind his own business and let the Radleys mind theirs, they had a right to; but when ithappened Jem said Atticus shook his head and said, Mm, mm, mm.

So Jem received most of his information from Miss Stephanie Crawford, aneighborhood scold, who said she knew the whole thing. According to Miss Stephanie,Boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from The Maycomb Tribune topaste in his scrapbook. His father entered the room. As Mr. Radley passed by, Boodrove the scissors into his parents leg, pulled them out, wiped them on his pants, andresumed his activities.

Mrs. Radley ran screaming into the street that Arthur was killing them all, but when thesheriff arrived he found Boo still sitting in the livingroom, cutting up the Tribune. He wasthirty-three years old then.

Miss Stephanie said old Mr. Radley said no Radley was going to any asylum, when itwas suggested that a season in Tuscaloosa might be helpful to Boo. Boo wasnt crazy,he was high-strung at times. It was all right to shut him up, Mr. Radley conceded, butinsisted that Boo not be charged with anything: he was not a criminal. The sheriff hadntthe heart to put him in jail alongside Negroes, so Boo was locked in the courthousebasement.

Boos transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in Jems memory.

Miss Stephanie Crawford said some of the town council told Mr. Radley that if he didnttake Boo back, Boo would die of mold from the damp. Besides, Boo could not liveforever on the bounty of the county.

Nobody knew what form of intimidation Mr. Radley employed to keep Boo out of sight,but Jem figured that Mr. Radley kept him chained to the bed most of the time. Atticussaid no, it wasnt that sort of thing, that there were other ways of making people intoghosts.

My memory came alive to see Mrs. Radley occasionally open the front door, walk tothe edge of the porch, and pour water on her cannas. But every day Jem and I wouldsee Mr. Radley walking to and from town. He was a thin leathery man with colorlesseyes, so colorless they did not reflect light. His cheekbones were sharp and his mouthwas wide, with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip. Miss Stephanie Crawford said he wasso upright he took the word of God as his only law, and we believed her, because Mr.

Radleys posture was ramrod straight.

He never spoke to us. When he passed we would look at the ground and say, Goodmorning, sir, and he would cough in reply. Mr. Radleys elder son lived in Pensacola; hecame home at Christmas, and he was one of the few persons we ever saw enter orleave the place. From the day Mr. Radley took Arthur home, people said the house died.

But there came a day when Atticus told us hed wear us out if we made any noise inthe yard and commissioned Calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a sound outof us. Mr. Radley was dying.

He took his time about it. Wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of theRadley lot, straw was put down on the sidewalk, traffic was diverted to the back street.

Dr. Reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the Radleys every timehe called. Jem and I crept around the yard for days. At last the sawhorses were takenaway, and we stood watching from the front porch when Mr. Radley made his finaljourney past our house.

There goes the meanest man ever God blew breath into, murmured Calpurnia, andshe spat meditatively into the yard. We looked at her in surprise, for Calpurnia rarelycommented on the ways of white people.

The neighborhood thought when Mr. Radley went under Boo would come out, but ithad another think coming: Boos elder brother returned from Pensacola and took Mr.

Radleys place. The only difference between him and his father was their ages. Jemsaid Mr. Nathan Radley bought cotton, too. Mr. Nathan would speak to us, however,when we said good morning, and sometimes we saw him coming from town with amagazine in his hand.

The more we told Dill about the Radleys, the more he wanted to know, the longer hewould stand hugging the light-pole on the corner, the more he would wonder.

Wonder what he does in there, he would murmur. Looks like hed just stick his headout the door.

Jem said, He goes out, all right, when its pitch dark. Miss Stephanie Crawford saidshe woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight throughthe window at her said his head was like a skull lookin at her. Aint you ever waked upat night and heard him, Dill? He walks like this- Jem slid his feet through the gravel.

Why do you think Miss Rachel locks up so tight at night? Ive seen his tracks in ourback yard many a mornin, and one night I heard him scratching on the back screen, buthe was gone time Atticus got there.

Wonder what he looks like? said Dill.

Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo: Boo was about six-and-a-half feet tall,judging from his tracks; he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch, thatswhy his hands were bloodstainedif you ate an animal raw, you could never wash theblood off. There was a long jagged scar that ran across his face; what teeth he had wereyellow and rotten; his eyes popped, and he drooled most of the time.

Lets try to make him come out, said Dill. Id like to see what he looks like.

Jem said if Dill wanted to get himself killed, all he had to do was go up and knock onthe front door.

Our first raid came to pass only because Dill bet Jem The Gray Ghost against twoTom Swifts that Jem wouldnt get any farther than the Radley gate. In all his life, Jemhad never declined a dare.

Jem thought about it for three days. I suppose he loved honor more than his head, forDill wore him down easily: Youre scared, Dill said, the first day. Aint scared, justrespectful, Jem said. The next day Dill said, Youre too scared even to put your big toein the front yard. Jem said he reckoned he wasnt, hed passed the Radley Place everyschool day of his life.

Always runnin, I said.

But Dill got him the third day, when he told Jem that folks in Meridian certainly werentas afraid as the folks in Maycomb, that hed never seen such scary folks as the ones inMaycomb.

This was enough to make Jem march to the corner, where he stopped and leanedagainst the light-pole, watching the gate hanging crazily on its homemade hinge.

I hope youve got it through your head that hell kill us each and every one, DillHarris, said Jem, when we joined him. Dont blame me when he gouges your eyes out.

You started it, remember.

Youre still scared, murmured Dill patiently.

Jem wanted Dill to know once and for all that he wasnt scared of anything: Its justthat I cant think of a way to make him come out without him gettin us. Besides, Jemhad his little sister to think of.

When he said that, I knew he was afraid. Jem had his little sister to think of the time Idared him to jump off the top of the house: If I got killed, whatd become of you? heasked. Then he jumped, landed unhurt, and his sense of responsibility left him untilconfronted by the Radley Place.

You gonna run out on a dare? asked Dill. If you are, then-

Dill, you have to think about these things, Jem said. Lemme think a minute itssort of like making a turtle come out

Hows that? asked Dill.

Strike a match under him.

I told Jem if he set fire to the Radley house I was going to tell Atticus on him.

Dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful.

Aint hateful, just persuades hims not like youd chunk him in the fire, Jemgrowled.

How do you know a match dont hurt him?

Turtles cant feel, stupid, said Jem.

Were you ever a turtle, huh?

My stars, Dill! Now lemme think reckon we can rock him

Jem stood in thought so long that Dill made a mild concession: I wont say you ranout on a dare an Ill swap you The Gray Ghost if you just go up and touch the house.

Jem brightened. Touch the house, that all?

Dill nodded.

Sure thats all, now? I dont want you hollerin something different the minute I getback.

Yeah, thats all, said Dill. Hell probably come out after you when he sees you in theyard, then Scoutn mell jump on him and hold him down till we can tell him we aintgonna hurt him.

We left the corner, crossed the side street that ran in front of the Radley house, andstopped at the gate.

Well go on, said Dill, Scout and mes right behind you.

Im going, said Jem, dont hurry me.

He walked to the corner of the lot, then back again, studying the simple terrain as ifdeciding how best to effect an entry, frowning and scratching his head.

Then I sneered at him.

Jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house, slapped it with his palmand ran back past us, not waiting to see if his foray was successful. Dill and I followedon his heels. Safely on our porch, panting and out of breath, we looked back.

The old house was the same, droopy and sick, but as we stared down the street wethought we saw an inside shutter move. Flick. A tiny, almost invisible movement, andthe house was still.

Chapter 2

Dill left us early in September, to return to Meridian. We saw him off on the five oclockbus and I was miserable without him until it occurred to me that I would be starting toschool in a week. I never looked forward more to anything in my life. Hours of wintertimehad found me in the treehouse, looking over at the schoolyard, spying on multitudes ofchildren through a two-power telescope Jem had given me, learning their games,following Jems red jacket through wriggling circles of blind mans buff, secretly sharingtheir misfortunes and minor victories. I longed to join them.

Jem condescended to take me to school the first day, a job usually done by onesparents, but Atticus had said Jem would be delighted to show me where my room was. Ithink some money changed hands in this transaction, for as we trotted around thecorner past the Radley Place I heard an unfamiliar jingle in Jems pockets. When weslowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard, Jem was careful to explain that duringschool hours I was not to bother him, I was not to approach him with requests to enact achapter of Tarzan and the Ant Men, to embarrass him with references to his private life,or tag along behind him at recess and noon. I was to stick with the first grade and hewould stick with the fifth. In short, I was to leave him alone.

You mean we cant play any more? I asked.

Well do like we always do at home, he said, but youll seeschools different.

It certainly was. Before the first morning was over, Miss Caroline Fisher, our teacher,hauled me up to the front of the room and patted the palm of my hand with a ruler, thenmade me stand in the corner until noon.

Miss Caroline was no more than twenty-one. She had bright auburn hair, pink cheeks,and wore crimson fingernail polish. She also wore high-heeled pumps and a red-and-white-striped dress. She looked and smelled like a peppermint drop. She boardedacross the street one door down from us in Miss Maudie Atkinsons upstairs front room,and when Miss Maudie introduced us to her, Jem was in a haze for days.

Miss Caroline printed her name on the blackboard and said, This says I am MissCaroline Fisher. I am from North Alabama, from Winston County. The class murmuredapprehensively, should she prove to harbor her share of the peculiarities indigenous tothat region. (When Alabama seceded from the Union on January 11, 1861, WinstonCounty seceded from Alabama, and every child in Maycomb County knew it.) NorthAlabama was full of Liquor Interests, Big Mules, steel companies, Republicans,professors, and other persons of no background.

Miss Caroline began the day by reading us a story about cats. The cats had longconversations with one another, they wore cunning little clothes and lived in a warmhouse beneath a kitchen stove. By the time Mrs. Cat called the drugstore for an order ofchocolate malted mice the class was wriggling like a bucketful of catawba worms. MissCaroline seemed unaware that the ragged, denim-shirted and floursack-skirted firstgrade, most of whom had chopped cotton and fed hogs from the time they were able towalk, were immune to imaginative literature. Miss Caroline came to the end of the storyand said, Oh, my, wasnt that nice?

Then she went to the blackboard and printed the alphabet in enormous squarecapitals, turned to the class and asked, Does anybody know what these are?

Everybody did; most of the first grade had failed it last year.

I suppose she chose me because she knew my name; as I read the alphabet a faintline appeared between her eyebrows, and after making me read most of My FirstReader and the stock-market quotations from The Mobile Register aloud, shediscovered that I was literate and looked at me with more than faint distaste. MissCaroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more, it would interfere with myreading.

Teach me? I said in surprise. He hasnt taught me anything, Miss Caroline. Atticusaint got time to teach me anything, I added, when Miss Caroline smiled and shook herhead. Why, hes so tired at night he just sits in the livingroom and reads.

If he didnt teach you, who did? Miss Caroline asked good-naturedly. Somebody did.

You werent born reading The Mobile Register.

Jem says I was. He read in a book where I was a Bullfinch instead of a Finch. Jemsays my names really Jean Louise Bullfinch, that I got swapped when I was born andIm really a-

Miss Caroline apparently thought I was lying. Lets not let our imaginations run awaywith us, dear, she said. Now you tell your father not to teach you any more. Its best tobegin reading with a fresh mind. You tell him Ill take over from here and try to undo thedamage-

Maam?

Your father does not know how to teach. You can have a seat now.

I mumbled that I was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime. I never deliberatelylearned to read, but somehow I had been wallowing illicitly in the daily papers. In thelong hours of churchwas it then I learned? I could not remember not being able toread hymns. Now that I was compelled to think about it, reading was something that justcame to me, as learning to fasten the seat of my union suit without looking around, orachieving two bows from a snarl of shoelaces. I could not remember when the linesabove Atticuss moving finger separated into words, but I had stared at them all theevenings in my memory, listening to the news of the day, Bills to Be Enacted into Laws,the diaries of Lorenzo Dowanything Atticus happened to be reading when I crawledinto his lap every night. Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does notlove breathing.

I knew I had annoyed Miss Caroline, so I let well enough alone and stared out thewindow until recess when Jem cut me from the covey of first-graders in the schoolyard.

He asked how I was getting along. I told him.

If I didnt have to stay Id leave. Jem, that damn lady says Atticuss been teaching meto read and for him to stop it-

Dont worry, Scout, Jem comforted me. Our teacher says Miss Carolinesintroducing a new way of teaching. She learned about it in college. Itll be in all thegrades soon. You dont have to learn much out of books that wayits like if you wantalearn about cows, you go milk one, see?

Yeah Jem, but I dont wanta study cows, I-

Sure you do. You hafta know about cows, theyre a big part of life in MaycombCounty.

I contented myself with asking Jem if hed lost his mind.

Im just trying to tell you the new way theyre teachin the first grade, stubborn. Its theDewey Decimal System.

Having never questioned Jems pronouncements, I saw no reason to begin now. TheDewey Decimal System consisted, in part, of Miss Caroline waving cards at us on whichwere printed the, cat, rat, man, and you. No comment seemed to be expected ofus, and the class received these impressionistic revelations in silence. I was bored, so Ibegan a letter to Dill. Miss Caroline caught me writing and told me to tell my father tostop teaching me. Besides, she said. We dont write in the first grade, we print. Youwont learn to write until youre in the third grade.

Calpurnia was to blame for this. It kept me from driving her crazy on rainy days, Iguess. She would set me a writing task by scrawling the alphabet firmly across the topof a tablet, then copying out a chapter of the Bible beneath. If I reproduced herpenmanship satisfactorily, she rewarded me with an open-faced sandwich of bread andbutter and sugar. In Calpurnias teaching, there was no sentimentality: I seldom pleasedher and she seldom rewarded me.

Everybody who goes home to lunch hold up your hands, said Miss Caroline,breaking into my new grudge against Calpurnia.

The town children did so, and she looked us over.

Everybody who brings his lunch put it on top of his desk.

Molasses buckets appeared from nowhere, and the ceiling danced with metallic light.

Miss Caroline walked up and down the rows peering and poking into lunch containers,nodding if the contents pleased her, frowning a little at others. She stopped at WalterCunninghams desk. Wheres yours? she asked.

Walter Cunninghams face told everybody in the first grade he had hookworms. Hisabsence of shoes told us how he got them. People caught hookworms going barefootedin barnyards and hog wallows. If Walter had owned any shoes he would have wornthem the first day of school and then discarded them until mid-winter. He did have on aclean shirt and neatly mended overalls.

Did you forget your lunch this morning? asked Miss Caroline.

Walter looked straight ahead. I saw a muscle jump in his skinny jaw.

Did you forget it this morning? asked Miss Caroline. Walters jaw twitched again.

Yebm, he finally mumbled.

Miss Caroline went to her desk and opened her purse. Heres a quarter, she said toWalter. Go and eat downtown today. You can pay me back tomorrow.

Walter shook his head. Nome thank you maam, he drawled softly.

Impatience crept into Miss Carolines voice: Here Walter, come get it.

Walter shook his head again.

When Walter shook his head a third time someone whispered, Go on and tell her,Scout.

I turned around and saw most of the town people and the entire bus delegationlooking at me. Miss Caroline and I had conferred twice already, and they were looking atme in the innocent assurance that familiarity breeds understanding.

I rose graciously on Walters behalf: AhMiss Caroline?

What is it, Jean Louise?

Miss Caroline, hes a Cunningham.

I sat back down.

What, Jean Louise?

I thought I had made things sufficiently clear. It was clear enough to the rest of us:

Walter Cunningham was sitting there lying his head off. He didnt forget his lunch, hedidnt have any. He had none today nor would he have any tomorrow or the next day.

He had probably never seen three quarters together at the same time in his life.

I tried again: Walters one of the Cunninghams, Miss Caroline.

I beg your pardon, Jean Louise?

Thats okay, maam, youll get to know all the county folks after a while. TheCunninghams never took anything they cant pay backno church baskets and no scripstamps. They never took anything off of anybody, they get along on what they have.

They dont have much, but they get along on it.

My special knowledge of the Cunningham tribeone branch, that iswas gainedfrom events of last winter. Walters father was one of Atticuss clients. After a drearyconversation in our livingroom one night about his entailment, before Mr. Cunninghamleft he said, Mr. Finch, I dont know when Ill ever be able to pay you.

Let that be the least of your worries, Walter, Atticus said.

When I asked Jem what entailment was, and Jem described it as a condition of havingyour tail in a crack, I asked Atticus if Mr. Cunningham would ever pay us.

Not in money, Atticus said, but before the years out Ill have been paid. You watch.

We watched. One morning Jem and I found a load of stovewood in the back yard.

Later, a sack of hickory nuts appeared on the back steps. With Christmas came a crateof smilax and holly. That spring when we found a crokersack full of turnip greens, Atticussaid Mr. Cunningham had more than paid him.

Why does he pay you like that? I asked.

Because thats the only way he can pay me. He has no money.

Are we poor, Atticus?

Atticus nodded. We are indeed.

Jems nose wrinkled. Are we as poor as the Cunninghams?

Not exactly. The Cunninghams are country folks, farmers, and the crash hit themhardest.

Atticus said professional people were poor because the farmers were poor. AsMaycomb County was farm country, nickels and dimes were hard to come by for doctorsand dentists and lawyers. Entailment was only a part of Mr. Cunninghams vexations.

The acres not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt, and the little cash he made went tointerest. If he held his mouth right, Mr. Cunningham could get a WPA job, but his landwould go to ruin if he left it, and he was willing to go hungry to keep his land and vote ashe pleased. Mr. Cunningham, said Atticus, came from a set breed of men.

As the Cunninghams had no money to pay a lawyer, they simply paid us with whatthey had. Did you know, said Atticus, that Dr. Reynolds works the same way? Hecharges some folks a bushel of potatoes for delivery of a baby. Miss Scout, if you giveme your attention Ill tell you what entailment is. Jems definitions are very nearlyaccurate sometimes.

If I could have explained these things to Miss Caroline, I would have saved myselfsome inconvenience and Miss Caroline subsequent mortification, but it was beyond myability to explain things as well as Atticus, so I said, Youre shamin him, Miss Caroline.

Walter hasnt got a quarter at home to bring you, and you cant use any stovewood.

Miss Caroline stood stock still, then grabbed me by the collar and hauled me back toher desk. Jean Louise, Ive had about enough of you this morning, she said. Yourestarting off on the wrong foot in every way, my dear. Hold out your hand.

I thought she was going to spit in it, which was the only reason anybody in Maycombheld out his hand: it was a time-honored method of sealing oral contracts. Wonderingwhat bargain we had made, I turned to the class for an answer, but the class lookedback at me in puzzlement. Miss Caroline picked up her ruler, gave me half a dozenquick little pats, then told me to stand in the corner. A storm of laughter broke loosewhen it finally occurred to the class that Miss Caroline had whipped me.

When Miss Caroline threatened it with a similar fate the first grade exploded again,becoming cold sober only when the shadow of Miss Blount fell over them. Miss Blount, anative Maycombian as yet uninitiated in the mysteries of the Decimal System, appearedat the door hands on hips and announced: If I hear another sound from this room Illburn up everybody in it. Miss Caroline, the sixth grade cannot concentrate on thepyramids for all this racket!

My sojourn in the corner was a short one. Saved by the bell, Miss Caroline watchedthe class file out for lunch. As I was the last to leave, I saw her sink down into her chairand bury her head in her arms. Had her conduct been more friendly toward me, I wouldhave felt sorry for her. She was a pretty little thing.


Chapter 3

Catching Walter Cunningham in the schoolyard gave me some pleasure, but when Iwas rubbing his nose in the dirt Jem came by and told me to stop. Youre biggern heis, he said.

Hes as old as you, nearly, I said. He made me start off on the wrong foot.

Let him go, Scout. Why?

He didnt have any lunch, I said, and explained my involvement in Walters dietaryaffairs.

Walter had picked himself up and was standing quietly listening to Jem and me. Hisfists were half cocked, as if expecting an onslaught from both of us. I stomped at him tochase him away, but Jem put out his hand and stopped me. He examined Walter withan air of speculation. Your daddy Mr. Walter Cunningham from Old Sarum? he asked,and Walter nodded.

Walter looked as if he had been raised on fish food: his eyes, as blue as Dill Harriss,were red-rimmed and watery. There was no color in his face except at the tip of hisnose, which was moistly pink. He fingered the straps of his overalls, nervously picking atthe metal hooks.

Jem suddenly grinned at him. Come on home to dinner with us, Walter, he said.

Wed be glad to have you.

Walters face brightened, then darkened.

Jem said, Our daddys a friend of your daddys. Scout here, shes crazyshe wontfight you any more.

I wouldnt be too certain of that, I said. Jems free dispensation of my pledge irkedme, but precious noontime minutes were ticking away. Yeah Walter, I wont jump onyou again. Dont you like butterbeans? Our Cals a real good cook.

Walter stood where he was, biting his lip. Jem and I gave up, and we were nearly tothe Radley Place when Walter called, Hey, Im comin!

When Walter caught up with us, Jem made pleasant conversation with him. A haintlives there, he said cordially, pointing to the Radley house. Ever hear about him,Walter?

Reckon I have, said Walter. Almost died first year I come to school and et thempecansfolks say he pizened em and put em over on the school side of the fence.

Jem seemed to have little fear of Boo Radley now that Walter and I walked besidehim. Indeed, Jem grew boastful: I went all the way up to the house once, he said toWalter.

Anybody who went up to the house once oughta not to still run every time he passesit, I said to the clouds above.

And whos runnin, Miss Priss?

You are, when aint anybody with you.

By the time we reached our front steps Walter had forgotten he was a Cunningham.

Jem ran to the kitchen and asked Calpurnia to set an extra plate, we had company.

Atticus greeted Walter and began a discussion about crops neither Jem nor I couldfollow.

Reason I cant pass the first grade, Mr. Finch, is Ive had to stay out ever spring an

help Papa with the choppin, but theres anothern at the house now thats field size.

Did you pay a bushel of potatoes for him? I asked, but Atticus shook his head at me.

While Walter piled food on his plate, he and Atticus talked together like two men, tothe wonderment of Jem and me. Atticus was expounding upon farm problems whenWalter interrupted to ask if there was any molasses in the house. Atticus summonedCalpurnia, who returned bearing the syrup pitcher. She stood waiting for Walter to helphimself. Walter poured syrup on his vegetables and meat with a generous hand. Hewould probably have poured it into his milk glass had I not asked what the sam hill hewas doing.

The silver saucer clattered when he replaced the pitcher, and he quickly put his handsin his lap. Then he ducked his head.

Atticus shook his head at me again. But hes gone and drowned his dinner in syrup, Iprotested. Hes poured it all over-

It was then that Calpurnia requested my presence in the kitchen.

She was furious, and when she was furious Calpurnias grammar became erratic.

When in tranquility, her grammar was as good as anybodys in Maycomb. Atticus saidCalpurnia had more education than most colored folks.

When she squinted down at me the tiny lines around her eyes deepened. Theressome folks who dont eat like us, she whispered fiercely, but you aint called on tocontradict em at the table when they dont. That boys yo compny and if he wants toeat up the table cloth you let him, you hear?

He aint company, Cal, hes just a Cunningham-

Hush your mouth! Dont matter who they are, anybody sets foot in this houses yocompny, and dont you let me catch you remarkin on their ways like you was so highand mighty! Yo folks might be bettern the Cunninghams but it dont count for nothin theway youre disgracin emif you cant act fit to eat at the table you can just set here andeat in the kitchen!

Calpurnia sent me through the swinging door to the diningroom with a stinging smack.

I retrieved my plate and finished dinner in the kitchen, thankful, though, that I wasspared the humiliation of facing them again. I told Calpurnia to just wait, Id fix her: oneof these days when she wasnt looking Id go off and drown myself in Barkers Eddy andthen shed be sorry. Besides, I added, shed already gotten me in trouble once today:

she had taught me to write and it was all her fault. Hush your fussin, she said.

Jem and Walter returned to school ahead of me: staying behind to advise Atticus ofCalpurnias iniquities was worth a solitary sprint past the Radley Place. She likes Jembettern she likes me, anyway, I concluded, and suggested that Atticus lose no time inpacking her off.

Have you ever considered that Jem doesnt worry her half as much? Atticuss voicewas flinty. Ive no intention of getting rid of her, now or ever. We couldnt operate asingle day without Cal, have you ever thought of that? You think about how much Caldoes for you, and you mind her, you hear?

I returned to school and hated Calpurnia steadily until a sudden shriek shattered myresentments. I looked up to see Miss Caroline standing in the middle of the room, sheerhorror flooding her face. Apparently she had revived enough to persevere in herprofession.

Its alive! she screamed.

The male population of the class rushed as one to her assistance. Lord, I thought,shes scared of a mouse. Little Chuck Little, whose patience with all living things wasphenomenal, said, Which way did he go, Miss Caroline? Tell us where he went, quick!

D.C.- he turned to a boy behind himD.C., shut the door and well catch him. Quick,maam, whered he go?

Miss Caroline pointed a shaking finger not at the floor nor at a desk, but to a hulkingindividual unknown to me. Little Chucks face contracted and he said gently, You meanhim, maam? Yessum, hes alive. Did he scare you some way?

Miss Caroline said desperately, I was just walking by when it crawled out of his hairjust crawled out of his hair-

Little Chuck grinned broadly. There aint no need to fear a cootie, maam. Aint youever seen one? Now dont you be afraid, you just go back to your desk and teach ussome more.

Little Chuck Little was another member of the population who didnt know where hisnext meal was coming from, but he was a born gentleman. He put his hand under herelbow and led Miss Caroline to the front of the room. Now dont you fret, maam, hesaid. There aint no need to fear a cootie. Ill just fetch you some cool water. Thecooties host showed not the faintest interest in the furor he had wrought. He searchedthe scalp above his forehead, located his guest and pinched it between his thumb andforefinger.

Miss Caroline watched the process in horrid fascination. Little Chuck brought water ina paper cup, and she drank it gratefully. Finally she found her voice. What is yourname, son? she asked softly.

The boy blinked. Who, me? Miss Caroline nodded.

Burris Ewell.

Miss Caroline inspected her roll-book. I have a Ewell here, but I dont have a firstname would you spell your first name for me?

Dont know how. They call me Burrist home.

Well, Burris, said Miss Caroline, I think wed better excuse you for the rest of theafternoon. I want you to go home and wash your hair.

From her desk she produced a thick volume, leafed through its pages and read for amoment. A good home remedy forBurris, I want you to go home and wash your hairwith lye soap. When youve done that, treat your scalp with kerosene.

What fer, missus?

To get rid of theer, cooties. You see, Burris, the other children might catch them,and you wouldnt want that, would you?

The boy stood up. He was the filthiest human I had ever seen. His neck was darkgray, the backs of his hands were rusty, and his fingernails were black deep into thequick. He peered at Miss Caroline from a fist-sized clean space on his face. No one hadnoticed him, probably, because Miss Caroline and I had entertained the class most ofthe morning.

And Burris, said Miss Caroline, please bathe yourself before you come backtomorrow.

The boy laughed rudely. You aint sendin me home, missus. I was on the verge ofleavinI done done my time for this year.

Miss Caroline looked puzzled. What do you mean by that?

The boy did not answer. He gave a short contemptuous snort.

One of the elderly members of the class answered her: Hes one of the Ewells,maam, and I wondered if this explanation would be as unsuccessful as my attempt. ButMiss Caroline seemed willing to listen. Whole schools full of em. They come first dayevery year and then leave. The truant lady gets em here cause she threatens em withthe sheriff, but shes give up tryin to hold em. She reckons shes carried out the law justgettin their names on the roll and runnin em here the first day. Youre supposed tomark em absent the rest of the year

But what about their parents? asked Miss Caroline, in genuine concern.

Aint got no mother, was the answer, and their paws right contentious.

Burris Ewell was flattered by the recital. Been comin to the first day o the first gradefer three year now, he said expansively. Reckon if Im smart this year theyll promoteme to the second

Miss Caroline said, Sit back down, please, Burris, and the moment she said it I knewshe had made a serious mistake. The boys condescension flashed to anger.

You try and make me, missus.

Little Chuck Little got to his feet. Let him go, maam, he said. Hes a mean one, ahard-down mean one. Hes liable to start somethin, and theres some little folks here.

He was among the most diminutive of men, but when Burris Ewell turned toward him,Little Chucks right hand went to his pocket. Watch your step, Burris, he said. Idsoons kill you as look at you. Now go home.

Burris seemed to be afraid of a child half his height, and Miss Caroline took advantageof his indecision: Burris, go home. If you dont Ill call the principal, she said. Ill haveto report this, anyway.

The boy snorted and slouched leisurely to the door.

Safely out of range, he turned and shouted: Report and be damned to ye! Aint nosnot-nosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born cn make me do nothin! You aint makin

me go nowhere, missus. You just remember that, you aint makin me go nowhere!

He waited until he was sure she was crying, then he shuffled out of the building.

Soon we were clustered around her desk, trying in our various ways to comfort her.

He was a real mean one below the belt you aint called on to teach folks like thatthem aint Maycombs ways, Miss Caroline, not really now dont you fret, maam. MissCaroline, why dont you read us a story? That cat thing was real fine this morninMiss Caroline smiled, blew her nose, said, Thank you, darlings, dispersed us,opened a book and mystified the first grade with a long narrative about a toadfrog thatlived in a hall.

When I passed the Radley Place for the fourth time that daytwice at a full gallopmy gloom had deepened to match the house. If the remainder of the school year wereas fraught with drama as the first day, perhaps it would be mildly entertaining, but theprospect of spending nine months refraining from reading and writing made me think ofrunning away.

By late afternoon most of my traveling plans were complete; when Jem and I racedeach other up the sidewalk to meet Atticus coming home from work, I didnt give himmuch of a race. It was our habit to run meet Atticus the moment we saw him round thepost office corner in the distance. Atticus seemed to have forgotten my noontime fallfrom grace; he was full of questions about school. My replies were monosyllabic and hedid not press me.

Perhaps Calpurnia sensed that my day had been a grim one: she let me watch her fixsupper. Shut your eyes and open your mouth and Ill give you a surprise, she said.

It was not often that she made crackling bread, she said she never had time, but withboth of us at school today had been an easy one for her. She knew I loved cracklingbread.

I missed you today, she said. The house got so lonesome long about two oclock Ihad to turn on the radio.

Why? Jemn me aint ever in the house unless its rainin.

I know, she said, But one of yous always in callin distance. I wonder how much ofthe day I spend just callin after you. Well, she said, getting up from the kitchen chair,its enough time to make a pan of cracklin bread, I reckon. You run along now and letme get supper on the table.

Calpurnia bent down and kissed me. I ran along, wondering what had come over her.

She had wanted to make up with me, that was it. She had always been too hard on me,she had at last seen the error of her fractious ways, she was sorry and too stubborn tosay so. I was weary from the days crimes.

After supper, Atticus sat down with the paper and called, Scout, ready to read? TheLord sent me more than I could bear, and I went to the front porch. Atticus followed me.

Something wrong, Scout?

I told Atticus I didnt feel very well and didnt think Id go to school any more if it was allright with him.

Atticus sat down in the swing and crossed his legs. His fingers wandered to hiswatchpocket; he said that was the only way he could think. He waited in amiablesilence, and I sought to reinforce my position: You never went to school and you do allright, so Ill just stay home too. You can teach me like Granddaddy taught you n UncleJack.

No I cant, said Atticus. I have to make a living. Besides, theyd put me in jail if I keptyou at homedose of magnesia for you tonight and school tomorrow.

Im feeling all right, really.

Thought so. Now whats the matter?

Bit by bit, I told him the days misfortunes. -and she said you taught me all wrong, sowe cant ever read any more, ever. Please dont send me back, please sir.

Atticus stood up and walked to the end of the porch. When he completed hisexamination of the wisteria vine he strolled back to me.

First of all, he said, if you can learn a simple trick, Scout, youll get along a lot betterwith all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider thingsfrom his point of view-

Sir?

-until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.

Atticus said I had learned many things today, and Miss Caroline had learned severalthings herself. She had learned not to hand something to a Cunningham, for one thing,but if Walter and I had put ourselves in her shoes wed have seen it was an honestmistake on her part. We could not expect her to learn all Maycombs ways in one day,and we could not hold her responsible when she knew no better.

Ill be dogged, I said. I didnt know no better than not to read to her, and she heldme responsiblelisten Atticus, I dont have to go to school! I was bursting with asudden thought. Burris Ewell, remember? He just goes to school the first day. Thetruant lady reckons shes carried out the law when she gets his name on the roll- Youcant do that, Scout, Atticus said. Sometimes its better to bend the law a little inspecial cases. In your case, the law remains rigid. So to school you must go.

I dont see why I have to when he doesnt.

Then listen.

Atticus said the Ewells had been the disgrace of Maycomb for three generations.

None of them had done an honest days work in his recollection. He said that someChristmas, when he was getting rid of the tree, he would take me with him and show mewhere and how they lived. They were people, but they lived like animals. They can goto school any time they want to, when they show the faintest symptom of wanting aneducation, said Atticus. There are ways of keeping them in school by force, but its sillyto force people like the Ewells into a new environment-

If I didnt go to school tomorrow, youd force me to.

Let us leave it at this, said Atticus dryly. You, Miss Scout Finch, are of the commonfolk. You must obey the law. He said that the Ewells were members of an exclusivesociety made up of Ewells. In certain circumstances the common folk judiciously allowedthem certain privileges by the simple method of becoming blind to some of the Ewells

activities. They didnt have to go to school, for one thing. Another thing, Mr. Bob Ewell,Burriss father, was permitted to hunt and trap out of season.

Atticus, thats bad, I said. In Maycomb County, hunting out of season was amisdemeanor at law, a capital felony in the eyes of the populace.

Its against the law, all right, said my father, and its certainly bad, but when a manspends his relief checks on green whiskey his children have a way of crying from hungerpains. I dont know of any landowner around here who begrudges those children anygame their father can hit.

Mr. Ewell shouldnt do that-

Of course he shouldnt, but hell never change his ways. Are you going to take outyour disapproval on his children?

No sir, I murmured, and made a final stand: But if I keep on goin to school, we cantever read any more

Thats really bothering you, isnt it?

Yes sir.

When Atticus looked down at me I saw the expression on his face that always mademe expect something. Do you know what a compromise is? he asked.

Bending the law?

No, an agreement reached by mutual concessions. It works this way, he said. Ifyoull concede the necessity of going to school, well go on reading every night just aswe always have. Is it a bargain?

Yes sir!

Well consider it sealed without the usual formality, Atticus said, when he saw mepreparing to spit.

As I opened the front screen door Atticus said, By the way, Scout, youd better notsay anything at school about our agreement.

Why not?

Im afraid our activities would be received with considerable disapprobation by themore learned authorities.

Jem and I were accustomed to our fathers last-will-and-testament diction, and wewere at all times free to interrupt Atticus for a translation when it was beyond ourunderstanding.

Huh, sir?

I never went to school, he said, but I have a feeling that if you tell Miss Caroline weread every night shell get after me, and I wouldnt want her after me.

Atticus kept us in fits that evening, gravely reading columns of print about a man whosat on a flagpole for no discernible reason, which was reason enough for Jem to spendthe following Saturday aloft in the treehouse. Jem sat from after breakfast until sunsetand would have remained overnight had not Atticus severed his supply lines. I hadspent most of the day climbing up and down, running errands for him, providing him withliterature, nourishment and water, and was carrying him blankets for the night whenAtticus said if I paid no attention to him, Jem would come down. Atticus was right.


Chapter 4

The remainder of my schooldays were no more auspicious than the first. Indeed, theywere an endless Project that slowly evolved into a Unit, in which miles of constructionpaper and wax crayon were expended by the State of Alabama in its well-meaning butfruitless efforts to teach me Group Dynamics. What Jem called the Dewey DecimalSystem was school-wide by the end of my first year, so I had no chance to compare itwith other teaching techniques. I could only look around me: Atticus and my uncle, whowent to school at home, knew everythingat least, what one didnt know the other did.

Furthermore, I couldnt help noticing that my father had served for years in the statelegislature, elected each time without opposition, innocent of the adjustments myteachers thought essential to the development of Good Citizenship. Jem, educated on ahalf-Decimal half-Duncecap basis, seemed to function effectively alone or in a group,but Jem was a poor example: no tutorial system devised by man could have stoppedhim from getting at books. As for me, I knew nothing except what I gathered from Timemagazine and reading everything I could lay hands on at home, but as I inchedsluggishly along the treadmill of the Maycomb County school system, I could not helpreceiving the impression that I was being cheated out of something. Out of what I knewnot, yet I did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what thestate had in mind for me.

As the year passed, released from school thirty minutes before Jem, who had to stayuntil three oclock, I ran by the Radley Place as fast as I could, not stopping until Ireached the safety of our front porch. One afternoon as I raced by, something caughtmy eye and caught it in such a way that I took a deep breath, a long look around, andwent back.

Two live oaks stood at the edge of the Radley lot; their roots reached out into the side-road and made it bumpy. Something about one of the trees attracted my attention.

Some tinfoil was sticking in a knot-hole just above my eye level, winking at me in theafternoon sun. I stood on tiptoe, hastily looked around once more, reached into the hole,and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer wrappers.

My first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible, but I rememberedwhere I was. I ran home, and on our front porch I examined my loot. The gum lookedfresh. I sniffed it and it smelled all right. I licked it and waited for a while. When I did notdie I crammed it into my mouth: Wrigleys Double-Mint.

When Jem came home he asked me where I got such a wad. I told him I found it.

Dont eat things you find, Scout.

This wasnt on the ground, it was in a tree.

Jem growled.

Well it was, I said. It was sticking in that tree yonder, the one comin from school.

Spit it out right now!

I spat it out. The tang was fading, anyway. Ive been chewin it all afternoon and I aintdead yet, not even sick.

Jem stamped his foot. Dont you know youre not supposed to even touch the treesover there? Youll get killed if you do!

You touched the house once!

That was different! You go gargleright now, you hear me?

Aint neither, itll take the taste outa my mouth.

You dont n Ill tell Calpurnia on you!

Rather than risk a tangle with Calpurnia, I did as Jem told me. For some reason, myfirst year of school had wrought a great change in our relationship: Calpurnias tyranny,unfairness, and meddling in my business had faded to gentle grumblings of generaldisapproval. On my part, I went to much trouble, sometimes, not to provoke her.

Summer was on the way; Jem and I awaited it with impatience. Summer was our bestseason: it was sleeping on the back screened porch in cots, or trying to sleep in thetreehouse; summer was everything good to eat; it was a thousand colors in a parchedlandscape; but most of all, summer was Dill.

The authorities released us early the last day of school, and Jem and I walked hometogether. Reckon old Dillll be coming home tomorrow, I said.

Probably day after, said Jem. Missippi turns em loose a day later.

As we came to the live oaks at the Radley Place I raised my finger to point for thehundredth time to the knot-hole where I had found the chewing gum, trying to make Jembelieve I had found it there, and found myself pointing at another piece of tinfoil.

I see it, Scout! I see it-

Jem looked around, reached up, and gingerly pocketed a tiny shiny package. We ranhome, and on the front porch we looked at a small box patchworked with bits of tinfoilcollected from chewing-gum wrappers. It was the kind of box wedding rings came in,purple velvet with a minute catch. Jem flicked open the tiny catch. Inside were twoscrubbed and polished pennies, one on top of the other. Jem examined them.

Indian-heads, he said. Nineteen-six and Scout, one of ems nineteen-hundred.

These are real old.

Nineteen-hundred, I echoed. Say-

Hush a minute, Im thinkin.

Jem, you reckon thats somebodys hidin place?

Naw, dont anybody much but us pass by there, unless its some grown persons-

Grown folks dont have hidin places. You reckon we ought to keep em, Jem?

I dont know what we could do, Scout. Whod we give em back to? I know for a factdont anybody go by thereCecil goes by the back street an all the way around by townto get home.

Cecil Jacobs, who lived at the far end of our street next door to the post office, walkeda total of one mile per school day to avoid the Radley Place and old Mrs. HenryLafayette Dubose. Mrs. Dubose lived two doors up the street from us; neighborhoodopinion was unanimous that Mrs. Dubose was the meanest old woman who ever lived.

Jem wouldnt go by her place without Atticus beside him.

What you reckon we oughta do, Jem?

Finders were keepers unless title was proven. Plucking an occasional camellia, gettinga squirt of hot milk from Miss Maudie Atkinsons cow on a summer day, helpingourselves to someones scuppernongs was part of our ethical culture, but money wasdifferent.

Tell you what, said Jem. Well keep em till school starts, then go around and askeverybody if theyre theirs. Theyre some bus childs, maybehe was too taken up withgettin outa school today an forgot em. These are somebodys, I know that. See howtheyve been slicked up? Theyve been saved.

Yeah, but why should somebody wanta put away chewing gum like that? You know itdoesnt last.

I dont know, Scout. But these are important to somebody

Hows that, Jem?

Well, Indian-headswell, they come from the Indians. Theyre real strong magic, theymake you have good luck. Not like fried chicken when youre not lookin for it, but thingslike long life n good health, n passin six-weeks tests these are real valuable tosomebody. Im gonna put em in my trunk.

Before Jem went to his room, he looked for a long time at the Radley Place. Heseemed to be thinking again.

Two days later Dill arrived in a blaze of glory: he had ridden the train by himself fromMeridian to Maycomb Junction (a courtesy titleMaycomb Junction was in AbbottCounty) where he had been met by Miss Rachel in Maycombs one taxi; he had eatendinner in the diner, he had seen two twins hitched together get off the train in Bay St.

Louis and stuck to his story regardless of threats. He had discarded the abominableblue shorts that were buttoned to his shirts and wore real short pants with a belt; he wassomewhat heavier, no taller, and said he had seen his father. Dills father was taller thanours, he had a black beard (pointed), and was president of the L & N Railroad.

I helped the engineer for a while, said Dill, yawning.

In a pigs ear you did, Dill. Hush, said Jem. Whatll we play today?

Tom and Sam and Dick, said Dill. Lets go in the front yard. Dill wanted the RoverBoys because there were three respectable parts. He was clearly tired of being ourcharacter man.

Im tired of those, I said. I was tired of playing Tom Rover, who suddenly lost hismemory in the middle of a picture show and was out of the script until the end, when hewas found in Alaska.

Make us up one, Jem, I said.

Im tired of makin em up.

Our first days of freedom, and we were tired. I wondered what the summer wouldbring.

We had strolled to the front yard, where Dill stood looking down the street at thedreary face of the Radley Place. Ismelldeath, he said. I do, I mean it, he said,when I told him to shut up.

You mean when somebodys dyin you can smell it?

No, I mean I can smell somebody an tell if theyre gonna die. An old lady taught mehow. Dill leaned over and sniffed me. JeanLouiseFinch, you are going to die inthree days.

Dill if you dont hush Ill knock you bowlegged. I mean it, now-

Yawl hush, growled Jem, you act like you believe in Hot Steams.

You act like you dont, I said.

Whats a Hot Steam? asked Dill.

Havent you ever walked along a lonesome road at night and passed by a hot place?

Jem asked Dill. A Hot Steams somebody who cant get to heaven, just wallows aroundon lonesome roads an if you walk through him, when you die youll be one too, an youllgo around at night suckin peoples breath-

How can you keep from passing through one?

You cant, said Jem. Sometimes they stretch all the way across the road, but if youhafta go through one you say, Angel-bright, life-in-death; get off the road, dont suck mybreath. That keeps em from wrapping around you-

Dont you believe a word he says, Dill, I said. Calpurnia says thats nigger-talk.

Jem scowled darkly at me, but said, Well, are we gonna play anything or not?

Lets roll in the tire, I suggested.

Jem sighed. You know Im too big.

You cn push.

I ran to the back yard and pulled an old car tire from under the house. I slapped it upto the front yard. Im first, I said.

Dill said he ought to be first, he just got here.

Jem arbitrated, awarded me first push with an extra time for Dill, and I folded myselfinside the tire.

Until it happened I did not realize that Jem was offended by my contradicting him onHot Steams, and that he was patiently awaiting an opportunity to reward me. He did, bypushing the tire down the sidewalk with all the force in his body. Ground, sky andhouses melted into a mad palette, my ears throbbed, I was suffocating. I could not putout my hands to stop, they were wedged between my chest and knees. I could onlyhope that Jem would outrun the tire and me, or that I would be stopped by a bump in thesidewalk. I heard him behind me, chasing and shouting.

The tire bumped on gravel, skeetered across the road, crashed into a barrier andpopped me like a cork onto pavement. Dizzy and nauseated, I lay on the cement andshook my head still, pounded my ears to silence, and heard Jems voice: Scout, getaway from there, come on!

I raised my head and stared at the Radley Place steps in front of me. I froze.

Come on, Scout, dont just lie there! Jem was screaming. Get up, cantcha?

I got to my feet, trembling as I thawed.

Get the tire! Jem hollered. Bring it with you! Aint you got any sense at all?

When I was able to navigate, I ran back to them as fast as my shaking knees wouldcarry me.

Why didnt you bring it? Jem yelled.

Why dont you get it? I screamed.

Jem was silent.

Go on, it aint far inside the gate. Why, you even touched the house once,remember?

Jem looked at me furiously, could not decline, ran down the sidewalk, treaded water atthe gate, then dashed in and retrieved the tire.

See there? Jem was scowling triumphantly. Nothin to it. I swear, Scout, sometimesyou act so much like a girl its mortifyin.

There was more to it than he knew, but I decided not to tell him.

Calpurnia appeared in the front door and yelled, Lemonade time! You all get in outathat hot sun fore you fry alive! Lemonade in the middle of the morning was asummertime ritual. Calpurnia set a pitcher and three glasses on the porch, then wentabout her business. Being out of Jems good graces did not worry me especially.

Lemonade would restore his good humor.

Jem gulped down his second glassful and slapped his chest. I know what we aregoing to play, he announced. Something new, something different.

What? asked Dill.

Boo Radley.

Jems head at times was transparent: he had thought that up to make me understandhe wasnt afraid of Radleys in any shape or form, to contrast his own fearless heroismwith my cowardice.

Boo Radley? How? asked Dill.

Jem said, Scout, you can be Mrs. Radley-

I declare if I will. I dont think-

Smatter? said Dill. Still scared?

He can get out at night when were all asleep I said.

Jem hissed. Scout, hows he gonna know what were doin? Besides, I dont thinkhes still there. He died years ago and they stuffed him up the chimney.

Dill said, Jem, you and me can play and Scout can watch if shes scared.

I was fairly sure Boo Radley was inside that house, but I couldnt prove it, and felt itbest to keep my mouth shut or I would be accused of believing in Hot Steams,phenomena I was immune to in the daytime.

Jem parceled out our roles: I was Mrs. Radley, and all I had to do was come out andsweep the porch. Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up and down the sidewalk andcoughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally, was Boo: he went under the frontsteps and shrieked and howled from time to time.

As the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected it, addeddialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang changesevery day.

Dill was a villains villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, andappear tall if height was part of the devilry required. He was as good as his worstperformance; his worst performance was Gothic. I reluctantly played assorted ladieswho entered the script. I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I played thatsummer with more than vague anxiety despite Jems assurances that Boo Radley wasdead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in the daytime and Atticushome at night.

Jem was a born hero.

It was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip andneighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she married Mr. Radley andlost all her money. She also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her right forefinger(Dills contribution. Boo bit it off one night when he couldnt find any cats and squirrels toeat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the time, while Boo slowly whittledaway all the furniture in the house.

The three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate judge, for achange; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with thebrushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff, assortedtownsfolk, and Miss Stephanie Crawford, who had more to say about the Radleys thananybody in Maycomb.

When it was time to play Boos big scene, Jem would sneak into the house, steal thescissors from the sewing-machine drawer when Calpurnias back was turned, then sit inthe swing and cut up newspapers. Dill would walk by, cough at Jem, and Jem wouldfake a plunge into Dills thigh. From where I stood it looked real.

When Mr. Nathan Radley passed us on his daily trip to town, we would stand still andsilent until he was out of sight, then wonder what he would do to us if he suspected. Ouractivities halted when any of the neighbors appeared, and once I saw Miss MaudieAtkinson staring across the street at us, her hedge clippers poised in midair.

One day we were so busily playing Chapter XXV, Book II of One Mans Family, we didnot see Atticus standing on the sidewalk looking at us, slapping a rolled magazineagainst his knee. The sun said twelve noon.

What are you all playing? he asked.

Nothing, said Jem.

Jems evasion told me our game was a secret, so I kept quiet.

What are you doing with those scissors, then? Why are you tearing up thatnewspaper? If its todays Ill tan you.

Nothing.

Nothing what? said Atticus.

Nothing, sir.

Give me those scissors, Atticus said. Theyre no things to play with. Does this byany chance have anything to do with the Radleys?

No sir, said Jem, reddening.

I hope it doesnt, he said shortly, and went inside the house.

Je-m

Shut up! Hes gone in the livingroom, he can hear us in there.

Safely in the yard, Dill asked Jem if we could play any more.

I dont know. Atticus didnt say we couldnt-

Jem, I said, I think Atticus knows it anyway.

No he dont. If he did hed say he did.

I was not so sure, but Jem told me I was being a girl, that girls always imagined things,thats why other people hated them so, and if I started behaving like one I could just gooff and find some to play with.

All right, you just keep it up then, I said. Youll find out.

Atticuss arrival was the second reason I wanted to quit the game. The first reasonhappened the day I rolled into the Radley front yard. Through all the head-shaking,quelling of nausea and Jem-yelling, I had heard another sound, so low I could not haveheard it from the sidewalk. Someone inside the house was laughing.

Chapter 5

My nagging got the better of Jem eventually, as I knew it would, and to my relief weslowed down the game for a while. He still maintained, however, that Atticus hadnt saidwe couldnt, therefore we could; and if Atticus ever said we couldnt, Jem had thought ofa way around it: he would simply change the names of the characters and then wecouldnt be accused of playing anything.

Dill was in hearty agreement with this plan of action. Dill was becoming something of atrial anyway, following Jem about. He had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him,then he promptly forgot about it. He staked me out, marked as his property, said I wasthe only girl he would ever love, then he neglected me. I beat him up twice but it did nogood, he only grew closer to Jem. They spent days together in the treehouse plottingand planning, calling me only when they needed a third party. But I kept aloof from theirmore foolhardy schemes for a while, and on pain of being called a girl, I spent most ofthe remaining twilights that summer sitting with Miss Maudie Atkinson on her frontporch.

Jem and I had always enjoyed the free run of Miss Maudies yard if we kept out of herazaleas, but our contact with her was not clearly defined. Until Jem and Dill excludedme from their plans, she was only another lady in the neighborhood, but a relativelybenign presence.

Our tacit treaty with Miss Maudie was that we could play on her lawn, eat herscuppernongs if we didnt jump on the arbor, and explore her vast back lot, terms sogenerous we seldom spoke to her, so careful were we to preserve the delicate balanceof our relationship, but Jem and Dill drove me closer to her with their behavior.

Miss Maudie hated her house: time spent indoors was time wasted. She was a widow,a chameleon lady who worked in her flower beds in an old straw hat and menscoveralls, but after her five oclock bath she would appear on the porch and reign overthe street in magisterial beauty.

She loved everything that grew in Gods earth, even the weeds. With one exception. Ifshe found a blade of nut grass in her yard it was like the Second Battle of the Marne:

she swooped down upon it with a tin tub and subjected it to blasts from beneath with apoisonous substance she said was so powerful itd kill us all if we didnt stand out of theway.

Why cant you just pull it up? I asked, after witnessing a prolonged campaign againsta blade not three inches high.

Pull it up, child, pull it up? She picked up the limp sprout and squeezed her thumb upits tiny stalk. Microscopic grains oozed out. Why, one sprig of nut grass can ruin awhole yard. Look here. When it comes fall this dries up and the wind blows it all overMaycomb County! Miss Maudies face likened such an occurrence unto an OldTestament pestilence.

Her speech was crisp for a Maycomb County inhabitant. She called us by all ournames, and when she grinned she revealed two minute gold prongs clipped to hereyeteeth. When I admired them and hoped I would have some eventually, she said,Look here. With a click of her tongue she thrust out her bridgework, a gesture ofcordiality that cemented our friendship.

Miss Maudies benevolence extended to Jem and Dill, whenever they paused in theirpursuits: we reaped the benefits of a talent Miss Maudie had hitherto kept hidden fromus. She made the best cakes in the neighborhood. When she was admitted into ourconfidence, every time she baked she made a big cake and three little ones, and shewould call across the street: Jem Finch, Scout Finch, Charles Baker Harris, comehere! Our promptness was always rewarded.

In summertime, twilights are long and peaceful. Often as not, Miss Maudie and I wouldsit silently on her porch, watching the sky go from yellow to pink as the sun went down,watching flights of martins sweep low over the neighborhood and disappear behind theschoolhouse rooftops.

Miss Maudie, I said one evening, do you think Boo Radleys still alive?

His names Arthur and hes alive, she said. She was rocking slowly in her big oakchair. Do you smell my mimosa? Its like angels breath this evening.

Yessum. How do you know?

Know what, child?

That BMr. Arthurs still alive?

What a morbid question. But I suppose its a morbid subject. I know hes alive, JeanLouise, because I havent seen him carried out yet.

Maybe he died and they stuffed him up the chimney.

Where did you get such a notion?

Thats what Jem said he thought they did.

S-ss-ss. He gets more like Jack Finch every day.

Miss Maudie had known Uncle Jack Finch, Atticuss brother, since they were children.

Nearly the same age, they had grown up together at Finchs Landing. Miss Maudie wasthe daughter of a neighboring landowner, Dr. Frank Buford. Dr. Bufords profession wasmedicine and his obsession was anything that grew in the ground, so he stayed poor.

Uncle Jack Finch confined his passion for digging to his window boxes in Nashville andstayed rich. We saw Uncle Jack every Christmas, and every Christmas he yelled acrossthe street for Miss Maudie to come marry him. Miss Maudie would yell back, Call a littlelouder, Jack Finch, and theyll hear you at the post office, I havent heard you yet! Jemand I thought this a strange way to ask for a ladys hand in marriage, but then UncleJack was rather strange. He said he was trying to get Miss Maudies goat, that he hadbeen trying unsuccessfully for forty years, that he was the last person in the world MissMaudie would think about marrying but the first person she thought about teasing, andthe best defense to her was spirited offense, all of which we understood clearly.

Arthur Radley just stays in the house, thats all, said Miss Maudie. Wouldnt you stayin the house if you didnt want to come out?

Yessum, but Id wanta come out. Why doesnt he?

Miss Maudies eyes narrowed. You know that story as well as I do.

I never heard why, though. Nobody ever told me why.

Miss Maudie settled her bridgework. You know old Mr. Radley was a foot-washingBaptist-

Thats what you are, aint it?

My shells not that hard, child. Im just a Baptist.

Dont you all believe in foot-washing?

We do. At home in the bathtub.

But we cant have communion with you all-

Apparently deciding that it was easier to define primitive baptistry than closedcommunion, Miss Maudie said: Foot-washers believe anything thats pleasure is a sin.

Did you know some of em came out of the woods one Saturday and passed by thisplace and told me me and my flowers were going to hell?

Your flowers, too?

Yes maam. Theyd burn right with me. They thought I spent too much time in Godsoutdoors and not enough time inside the house reading the Bible.

My confidence in pulpit Gospel lessened at the vision of Miss Maudie stewing foreverin various Protestant hells. True enough, she had an acid tongue in her head, and shedid not go about the neighborhood doing good, as did Miss Stephanie Crawford. Butwhile no one with a grain of sense trusted Miss Stephanie, Jem and I had considerablefaith in Miss Maudie. She had never told on us, had never played cat-and-mouse withus, she was not at all interested in our private lives. She was our friend. How soreasonable a creature could live in peril of everlasting torment was incomprehensible.

That aint right, Miss Maudie. Youre the best lady I know.

Miss Maudie grinned. Thank you maam. Thing is, foot-washers think women are asin by definition. They take the Bible literally, you know.

Is that why Mr. Arthur stays in the house, to keep away from women?

Ive no idea.

It doesnt make sense to me. Looks like if Mr. Arthur was hankerin after heaven hedcome out on the porch at least. Atticus says Gods loving folks like you love yourself-

Miss Maudie stopped rocking, and her voice hardened. You are too young tounderstand it, she said, but sometimes the Bible in the hand of one man is worse thana whiskey bottle in the hand ofoh, of your father.

I was shocked. Atticus doesnt drink whiskey, I said. He never drunk a drop in hislifenome, yes he did. He said he drank some one time and didnt like it.

Miss Maudie laughed. Wasnt talking about your father, she said. What I meant was,if Atticus Finch drank until he was drunk he wouldnt be as hard as some men are attheir best. There are just some kind of men whowhore so busy worrying about thenext world theyve never learned to live in this one, and you can look down the streetand see the results.

Do you think theyre true, all those things they say about BMr. Arthur?

What things?

I told her.

That is three-fourths colored folks and one-fourth Stephanie Crawford, said MissMaudie grimly. Stephanie Crawford even told me once she woke up in the middle of thenight and found him looking in the window at her. I said what did you do, Stephanie,move over in the bed and make room for him? That shut her up a while.

I was sure it did. Miss Maudies voice was enough to shut anybody up.

No, child, she said, that is a sad house. I remember Arthur Radley when he was aboy. He always spoke nicely to me, no matter what folks said he did. Spoke as nicely ashe knew how.

You reckon hes crazy?

Miss Maudie shook her head. If hes not he should be by now. The things that happento people we never really know. What happens in houses behind closed doors, whatsecrets-

Atticus dont ever do anything to Jem and me in the house that he dont do in theyard, I said, feeling it my duty to defend my parent.

Gracious child, I was raveling a thread, wasnt even thinking about your father, butnow that I am Ill say this: Atticus Finch is the same in his house as he is on the publicstreets. Howd you like some fresh poundcake to take home?

I liked it very much.

Next morning when I awakened I found Jem and Dill in the back yard deep inconversation. When I joined them, as usual they said go away.

Will not. This yards as much mine as it is yours, Jem Finch. I got just as much right toplay in it as you have.

Dill and Jem emerged from a brief huddle: If you stay youve got to do what we tellyou, Dill warned.

We-ll, I said, whos so high and mighty all of a sudden?

If you dont say youll do what we tell you, we aint gonna tell you anything, Dillcontinued.

You act like you grew ten inches in the night! All right, what is it?

Jem said placidly, We are going to give a note to Boo Radley.

Just how? I was trying to fight down the automatic terror rising in me. It was all rightfor Miss Maudie to talkshe was old and snug on her porch. It was different for us.

Jem was merely going to put the note on the end of a fishing pole and stick it throughthe shutters. If anyone came along, Dill would ring the bell.

Dill raised his right hand. In it was my mothers silver dinner-bell.

Im goin around to the side of the house, said Jem. We looked yesterday fromacross the street, and theres a shutter loose. Think maybe I can make it stick on thewindow sill, at least.

Jem-

Now youre in it and you cant get out of it, youll just stay in it, Miss Priss!

Okay, okay, but I dont wanta watch. Jem, somebody was-

Yes you will, youll watch the back end of the lot and Dills gonna watch the front ofthe house an up the street, an if anybody comes hell ring the bell. That clear?

All right then. Whatd you write him?

Dill said, Were askin him real politely to come out sometimes, and tell us what hedoes in therewe said we wouldnt hurt him and wed buy him an ice cream.

You allve gone crazy, hell kill us!

Dill said, Its my idea. I figure if hed come out and sit a spell with us he might feelbetter.

How do you know he dont feel good?

Well howd you feel if youd been shut up for a hundred years with nothin but cats toeat? I bet hes got a beard down to here- Like your daddys?

He aint got a beard, he- Dill stopped, as if trying to remember.

Uh huh, caughtcha, I said. You said fore you were off the train good your daddyhad a black beard-

If its all the same to you he shaved it off last summer! Yeah, an Ive got the letter toprove ithe sent me two dollars, too!

Keep onI reckon he even sent you a mounted police uniform! Thatn never showedup, did it? You just keep on tellin em, son-

Dill Harris could tell the biggest ones I ever heard. Among other things, he had beenup in a mail plane seventeen times, he had been to Nova Scotia, he had seen anelephant, and his granddaddy was Brigadier General Joe Wheeler and left him hissword.

You all hush, said Jem. He scuttled beneath the house and came out with a yellowbamboo pole. Reckon this is long enough to reach from the sidewalk?

Anybody whos brave enough to go up and touch the house hadnt oughta use afishin pole, I said. Why dont you just knock the front door down?

Thisisdifferent, said Jem, how many times do I have to tell you that?

Dill took a piece of paper from his pocket and gave it to Jem. The three of us walkedcautiously toward the old house. Dill remained at the light-pole on the front corner of thelot, and Jem and I edged down the sidewalk parallel to the side of the house. I walkedbeyond Jem and stood where I could see around the curve.

All clear, I said. Not a soul in sight.

Jem looked up the sidewalk to Dill, who nodded.

Jem attached the note to the end of the fishing pole, let the pole out across the yardand pushed it toward the window he had selected. The pole lacked several inches ofbeing long enough, and Jem leaned over as far as he could. I watched him makingjabbing motions for so long, I abandoned my post and went to him.

Cant get it off the pole, he muttered, or if I got it off I cant make it stay. Gon backdown the street, Scout.

I returned and gazed around the curve at the empty road. Occasionally I looked backat Jem, who was patiently trying to place the note on the window sill. It would flutter tothe ground and Jem would jab it up, until I thought if Boo Radley ever received it hewouldnt be able to read it. I was looking down the street when the dinner-bell rang.

Shoulder up, I reeled around to face Boo Radley and his bloody fangs; instead, I sawDill ringing the bell with all his might in Atticuss face.

Jem looked so awful I didnt have the heart to tell him I told him so. He trudged along,dragging the pole behind him on the sidewalk.

Atticus said, Stop ringing that bell.

Dill grabbed the clapper; in the silence that followed, I wished hed start ringing itagain. Atticus pushed his hat to the back of his head and put his hands on his hips.

Jem, he said, what were you doing?

Nothin, sir.

I dont want any of that. Tell me.

I waswe were just tryin to give somethin to Mr. Radley.

What were you trying to give him?

Just a letter.

Let me see it.

Jem held out a filthy piece of paper. Atticus took it and tried to read it. Why do youwant Mr. Radley to come out?

Dill said, We thought he might enjoy us and dried up when Atticus looked at him.

Son, he said to Jem, Im going to tell you something and tell you one time: stoptormenting that man. That goes for the other two of you.

What Mr. Radley did was his own business. If he wanted to come out, he would. If hewanted to stay inside his own house he had the right to stay inside free from theattentions of inquisitive children, which was a mild term for the likes of us. How wouldwe like it if Atticus barged in on us without knocking, when we were in our rooms atnight? We were, in effect, doing the same thing to Mr. Radley. What Mr. Radley didmight seem peculiar to us, but it did not seem peculiar to him. Furthermore, had it neveroccurred to us that the civil way to communicate with another being was by the frontdoor instead of a side window? Lastly, we were to stay away from that house until wewere invited there, we were not to play an asinine game he had seen us playing ormake fun of anybody on this street or in this town-We werent makin fun of him, we werent laughin at him, said Jem, we were just-

So that was what you were doing, wasnt it?

Makin fun of him?

No, said Atticus, putting his lifes history on display for the edification of theneighborhood.

Jem seemed to swell a little. I didnt say we were doin that, I didnt say it!

Atticus grinned dryly. You just told me, he said. You stop this nonsense right now,every one of you.

Jem gaped at him.

You want to be a lawyer, dont you? Our fathers mouth was suspiciously firm, as ifhe were trying to hold it in line.

Jem decided there was no point in quibbling, and was silent. When Atticus went insidethe house to retrieve a file he had forgotten to take to work that morning, Jem finallyrealized that he had been done in by the oldest lawyers trick on record. He waited arespectful distance from the front steps, watched Atticus leave the house and walktoward town. When Atticus was out of earshot Jem yelled after him: I thought I wantedto be a lawyer but I aint so sure now!

Chapter 6

Yes, said our father, when Jem asked him if we could go over and sit by MissRachels fishpool with Dill, as this was his last night in Maycomb. Tell him so long forme, and well see him next summer.

We leaped over the low wall that separated Miss Rachels yard from our driveway.

Jem whistled bob-white and Dill answered in the darkness.

Not a breath blowing, said Jem. Looka yonder.

He pointed to the east. A gigantic moon was rising behind Miss Maudies pecan trees.

That makes it seem hotter, he said.

Cross in it tonight? asked Dill, not looking up. He was constructing a cigarette fromnewspaper and string.

No, just the lady. Dont light that thing, Dill, youll stink up this whole end of town.

There was a lady in the moon in Maycomb. She sat at a dresser combing her hair.

Were gonna miss you, boy, I said. Reckon we better watch for Mr. Avery?

Mr. Avery boarded across the street from Mrs. Henry Lafayette Duboses house.

Besides making change in the collection plate every Sunday, Mr. Avery sat on the porchevery night until nine oclock and sneezed. One evening we were privileged to witness aperformance by him which seemed to have been his positively last, for he never did itagain so long as we watched. Jem and I were leaving Miss Rachels front steps onenight when Dill stopped us: Golly, looka yonder. He pointed across the street. At firstwe saw nothing but a kudzu-covered front porch, but a closer inspection revealed an arcof water descending from the leaves and splashing in the yellow circle of the street light,some ten feet from source to earth, it seemed to us. Jem said Mr. Avery misfigured, Dillsaid he must drink a gallon a day, and the ensuing contest to determine relativedistances and respective prowess only made me feel left out again, as I was untalentedin this area.

Dill stretched, yawned, and said altogether too casually. I know what, lets go for awalk.

He sounded fishy to me. Nobody in Maycomb just went for a walk. Where to, Dill?

Dill jerked his head in a southerly direction.

Jem said, Okay. When I protested, he said sweetly, You dont have to come along,Angel May.

You dont have to go. Remember-

Jem was not one to dwell on past defeats: it seemed the only message he got fromAtticus was insight into the art of cross examination. Scout, we aint gonna do anything,were just goin to the street light and back.

We strolled silently down the sidewalk, listening to porch swings creaking with theweight of the neighborhood, listening to the soft night-murmurs of the grown people onour street. Occasionally we heard Miss Stephanie Crawford laugh.

Well? said Dill.

Okay, said Jem. Why dont you go on home, Scout?

What are you gonna do?

Dill and Jem were simply going to peep in the window with the loose shutter to see ifthey could get a look at Boo Radley, and if I didnt want to go with them I could gostraight home and keep my fat flopping mouth shut, that was all.

But what in the sam holy hill did you wait till tonight?

Because nobody could see them at night, because Atticus would be so deep in a bookhe wouldnt hear the Kingdom coming, because if Boo Radley killed them theyd missschool instead of vacation, and because it was easier to see inside a dark house in thedark than in the daytime, did I understand?

Jem, please-

Scout, Im tellin you for the last time, shut your trap or go homeI declare to the Lordyoure gettin more like a girl every day!

With that, I had no option but to join them. We thought it was better to go under thehigh wire fence at the rear of the Radley lot, we stood less chance of being seen. Thefence enclosed a large garden and a narrow wooden outhouse.

Jem held up the bottom wire and motioned Dill under it. I followed, and held up thewire for Jem. It was a tight squeeze for him. Dont make a sound, he whispered. Dontget in a row of collards whatever you do, theyll wake the dead.

With this thought in mind, I made perhaps one step per minute. I moved faster when Isaw Jem far ahead beckoning in the moonlight. We came to the gate that divided thegarden from the back yard. Jem touched it. The gate squeaked.

Spit on it, whispered Dill.

Youve got us in a box, Jem, I muttered. We cant get out of here so easy.

Sh-h. Spit on it, Scout.

We spat ourselves dry, and Jem opened the gate slowly, lifting it aside and resting iton the fence. We were in the back yard.

The back of the Radley house was less inviting than the front: a ramshackle porch ranthe width of the house; there were two doors and two dark windows between the doors.

Instead of a column, a rough two-by-four supported one end of the roof. An old Franklinstove sat in a corner of the porch; above it a hat-rack mirror caught the moon and shoneeerily.

Ar-r, said Jem softly, lifting his foot.

Smatter?

Chickens, he breathed.

That we would be obliged to dodge the unseen from all directions was confirmed whenDill ahead of us spelled G-o-d in a whisper. We crept to the side of the house, around tothe window with the hanging shutter. The sill was several inches taller than Jem.

Give you a hand up, he muttered to Dill. Wait, though. Jem grabbed his left wristand my right wrist, I grabbed my left wrist and Jems right wrist, we crouched, and Dillsat on our saddle. We raised him and he caught the window sill.

Hurry, Jem whispered, we cant last much longer.

Dill punched my shoulder, and we lowered him to the ground.

Whatd you see?

Nothing. Curtains. Theres a little teeny light way off somewhere, though.

Lets get away from here, breathed Jem. Lets go round in back again. Sh-h, hewarned me, as I was about to protest.

Lets try the back window.

Dill, no, I said.

Dill stopped and let Jem go ahead. When Jem put his foot on the bottom step, thestep squeaked. He stood still, then tried his weight by degrees. The step was silent. Jemskipped two steps, put his foot on the porch, heaved himself to it, and teetered a longmoment. He regained his balance and dropped to his knees. He crawled to the window,raised his head and looked in.

Then I saw the shadow. It was the shadow of a man with a hat on. At first I thought itwas a tree, but there was no wind blowing, and tree-trunks never walked. The backporch was bathed in moonlight, and the shadow, crisp as toast, moved across the porchtoward Jem.

Dill saw it next. He put his hands to his face.

When it crossed Jem, Jem saw it. He put his arms over his head and went rigid.

The shadow stopped about a foot beyond Jem. Its arm came out from its side,dropped, and was still. Then it turned and moved back across Jem, walked along theporch and off the side of the house, returning as it had come.

Jem leaped off the porch and galloped toward us. He flung open the gate, danced Dilland me through, and shooed us between two rows of swishing collards. Halfwaythrough the collards I tripped; as I tripped the roar of a shotgun shattered theneighborhood.

Dill and Jem dived beside me. Jems breath came in sobs: Fence by theschoolyard!hurry, Scout!

Jem held the bottom wire; Dill and I rolled through and were halfway to the shelter ofthe schoolyards solitary oak when we sensed that Jem was not with us. We ran backand found him struggling in the fence, kicking his pants off to get loose. He ran to theoak tree in his shorts.

Safely behind it, we gave way to numbness, but Jems mind was racing: We gotta gethome, theyll miss us.

We ran across the schoolyard, crawled under the fence to Deers Pasture behind ourhouse, climbed our back fence and were at the back steps before Jem would let uspause to rest.

Respiration normal, the three of us strolled as casually as we could to the front yard.

We looked down the street and saw a circle of neighbors at the Radley front gate.

We better go down there, said Jem. Theyll think its funny if we dont show up.

Mr. Nathan Radley was standing inside his gate, a shotgun broken across his arm.

Atticus was standing beside Miss Maudie and Miss Stephanie Crawford. Miss Racheland Mr. Avery were near by. None of them saw us come up.

We eased in beside Miss Maudie, who looked around. Where were you all, didnt youhear the commotion?

What happened? asked Jem.

Mr. Radley shot at a Negro in his collard patch.

Oh. Did he hit him?

No, said Miss Stephanie. Shot in the air. Scared him pale, though. Says if anybodysees a white nigger around, thats the one. Says hes got the other barrel waitin for thenext sound he hears in that patch, an next time he wont aim high, be it dog, nigger,orJem Finch!

Maam? asked Jem.

Atticus spoke. Wherere your pants, son?

Pants, sir?

Pants.

It was no use. In his shorts before God and everybody. I sighed.

AhMr. Finch?

In the glare from the streetlight, I could see Dill hatching one: his eyes widened, his fatcherub face grew rounder.

What is it, Dill? asked Atticus.

AhI won em from him, he said vaguely.

Won them? How?

Dills hand sought the back of his head. He brought it forward and across his forehead.

We were playin strip poker up yonder by the fishpool, he said.

Jem and I relaxed. The neighbors seemed satisfied: they all stiffened. But what wasstrip poker?

We had no chance to find out: Miss Rachel went off like the town fire siren: Do-o-oJee-sus, Dill Harris! Gamblin by my fishpool? Ill strip-poker you, sir!

Atticus saved Dill from immediate dismemberment. Just a minute, Miss Rachel, hesaid. Ive never heard of em doing that before. Were you all playing cards?

Jem fielded Dills fly with his eyes shut: No sir, just with matches.

I admired my brother. Matches were dangerous, but cards were fatal.

Jem, Scout, said Atticus, I dont want to hear of poker in any form again. Go by Dillsand get your pants, Jem. Settle it yourselves.

Dont worry, Dill, said Jem, as we trotted up the sidewalk, she aint gonna get you.

Hell talk her out of it. That was fast thinkin, son. Listen you hear?

We stopped, and heard Atticuss voice:not serious they all go through it, MissRachel

Dill was comforted, but Jem and I werent. There was the problem of Jem showing upsome pants in the morning.

d give you some of mine, said Dill, as we came to Miss Rachels steps. Jem said hecouldnt get in them, but thanks anyway. We said good-bye, and Dill went inside thehouse. He evidently remembered he was engaged to me, for he ran back out and kissedme swiftly in front of Jem. Yawl write, hear? he bawled after us.

Had Jems pants been safely on him, we would not have slept much anyway. Everynight-sound I heard from my cot on the back porch was magnified three-fold; everyscratch of feet on gravel was Boo Radley seeking revenge, every passing Negrolaughing in the night was Boo Radley loose and after us; insects splashing against thescreen were Boo Radleys insane fingers picking the wire to pieces; the chinaberry treeswere malignant, hovering, alive. I lingered between sleep and wakefulness until I heardJem murmur.

Sleep, Little Three-Eyes?

Are you crazy?

Sh-h. Atticuss lights out.

In the waning moonlight I saw Jem swing his feet to the floor.

Im goin after em, he said.

I sat upright. You cant. I wont let you.

He was struggling into his shirt. Ive got to.

You do an Ill wake up Atticus.

You do and Ill kill you.

I pulled him down beside me on the cot. I tried to reason with him. Mr. Nathansgonna find em in the morning, Jem. He knows you lost em. When he shows em toAtticus itll be pretty bad, thats all there is to it. Gon back to bed.

Thats what I know, said Jem. Thats why Im goin after em.

I began to feel sick. Going back to that place by himselfI remembered MissStephanie: Mr. Nathan had the other barrel waiting for the next sound he heard, be itnigger, dog Jem knew that better than I.

I was desperate: Look, it aint worth it, Jem. A lickin hurts but it doesnt last. Youll getyour head shot off, Jem. Please

He blew out his breath patiently. Iits like this, Scout, he muttered. Atticus aintever whipped me since I can remember. I wanta keep it that way.

This was a thought. It seemed that Atticus threatened us every other day. You meanhes never caught you at anything.

Maybe so, butI just wanta keep it that way, Scout. We shouldna done that tonight,Scout.

It was then, I suppose, that Jem and I first began to part company. Sometimes I didnot understand him, but my periods of bewilderment were short-lived. This was beyondme. Please, I pleaded, cantcha just think about it for a minuteby yourself on thatplace

Shut up!

Its not like hed never speak to you again or somethin Im gonna wake him up,Jem, I swear I am

Jem grabbed my pajama collar and wrenched it tight. Then Im goin with you Ichoked.

No you aint, youll just make noise.

It was no use. I unlatched the back door and held it while he crept down the steps. Itmust have been two oclock. The moon was setting and the lattice-work shadows werefading into fuzzy nothingness. Jems white shirt-tail dipped and bobbed like a smallghost dancing away to escape the coming morning. A faint breeze stirred and cooledthe sweat running down my sides.

He went the back way, through Deers Pasture, across the schoolyard and around tothe fence, I thoughtat least that was the way he was headed. It would take longer, soit was not time to worry yet. I waited until it was time to worry and listened for Mr.

Radleys shotgun. Then I thought I heard the back fence squeak. It was wishful thinking.

Then I heard Atticus cough. I held my breath. Sometimes when we made a midnightpilgrimage to the bathroom we would find him reading. He said he often woke up duringthe night, checked on us, and read himself back to sleep. I waited for his light to go on,straining my eyes to see it flood the hall. It stayed off, and I breathed again. The night-crawlers had retired, but ripe chinaberries drummed on the roof when the wind stirred,and the darkness was desolate with the barking of distant dogs.

There he was, returning to me. His white shirt bobbed over the back fence and slowlygrew larger. He came up the back steps, latched the door behind him, and sat on hiscot. Wordlessly, he held up his pants. He lay down, and for a while I heard his cottrembling. Soon he was still. I did not hear him stir again.

Chapter 7

Jem stayed moody and silent for a week. As Atticus had once advised me to do, I triedto climb into Jems skin and walk around in it: if I had gone alone to the Radley Place attwo in the morning, my funeral would have been held the next afternoon. So I left Jemalone and tried not to bother him.

School started. The second grade was as bad as the first, only worsethey stillflashed cards at you and wouldnt let you read or write. Miss Carolines progress nextdoor could be estimated by the frequency of laughter; however, the usual crew hadflunked the first grade again, and were helpful in keeping order. The only thing goodabout the second grade was that this year I had to stay as late as Jem, and we usuallywalked home together at three oclock.

One afternoon when we were crossing the schoolyard toward home, Jem suddenlysaid: Theres something I didnt tell you.

As this was his first complete sentence in several days, I encouraged him: Aboutwhat?

About that night.

Youve never told me anything about that night, I said.

Jem waved my words away as if fanning gnats. He was silent for a while, then he said,When I went back for my breechesthey were all in a tangle when I was gettin out ofem, I couldnt get em loose. When I went back Jem took a deep breath. When Iwent back, they were folded across the fence like they were expectin me.

Across

And something else Jems voice was flat. Show you when we get home. Theydbeen sewed up. Not like a lady sewed em, like somethin Id try to do. All crooked. Itsalmost like

somebody knew you were comin back for em.

Jem shuddered. Like somebody was readin my mind like somebody could tell whatI was gonna do. Cant anybody tell what Im gonna do lest they know me, can they,Scout?

Jems question was an appeal. I reassured him: Cant anybody tell what youre gonnado lest they live in the house with you, and even I cant tell sometimes.

We were walking past our tree. In its knot-hole rested a ball of gray twine.

Dont take it, Jem, I said. This is somebodys hidin place.

I dont think so, Scout.

Yes it is. Somebody like Walter Cunningham comes down here every recess andhides his thingsand we come along and take em away from him. Listen, lets leave itand wait a couple of days. If it aint gone then, well take it, okay?

Okay, you might be right, said Jem. It must be some little kids placehides histhings from the bigger folks. You know its only when schools in that weve foundthings.

Yeah, I said, but we never go by here in the summertime.

We went home. Next morning the twine was where we had left it. When it was stillthere on the third day, Jem pocketed it. From then on, we considered everything wefound in the knot-hole our property.

The second grade was grim, but Jem assured me that the older I got the better schoolwould be, that he started off the same way, and it was not until one reached the sixthgrade that one learned anything of value. The sixth grade seemed to please him fromthe beginning: he went through a brief Egyptian Period that baffled mehe tried to walkflat a great deal, sticking one arm in front of him and one in back of him, putting one footbehind the other. He declared Egyptians walked that way; I said if they did I didnt seehow they got anything done, but Jem said they accomplished more than the Americansever did, they invented toilet paper and perpetual embalming, and asked where wouldwe be today if they hadnt? Atticus told me to delete the adjectives and Id have thefacts.

There are no clearly defined seasons in South Alabama; summer drifts into autumn,and autumn is sometimes never followed by winter, but turns to a days-old spring thatmelts into summer again. That fall was a long one, hardly cool enough for a light jacket.

Jem and I were trotting in our orbit one mild October afternoon when our knot-holestopped us again. Something white was inside this time.

Jem let me do the honors: I pulled out two small images carved in soap. One was thefigure of a boy, the other wore a crude dress. Before I remembered that there was nosuch thing as hoo-dooing, I shrieked and threw them down.

Jem snatched them up. Whats the matter with you? he yelled. He rubbed the figuresfree of red dust. These are good, he said. Ive never seen any these good.

He held them down to me. They were almost perfect miniatures of two children. Theboy had on shorts, and a shock of soapy hair fell to his eyebrows. I looked up at Jem. Apoint of straight brown hair kicked downwards from his part. I had never noticed itbefore. Jem looked from the girl-doll to me. The girl-doll wore bangs. So did I.

These are us, he said.

Who did em, you reckon?

Who do we know around here who whittles? he asked.

Mr. Avery.

Mr. Avery just does like this. I mean carves.

Mr. Avery averaged a stick of stovewood per week; he honed it down to a toothpickand chewed it.

Theres old Miss Stephanie Crawfords sweetheart, I said.

He carves all right, but he lives down the country. When would he ever pay anyattention to us?

Maybe he sits on the porch and looks at us instead of Miss Stephanie. If I was him, Iwould.

Jem stared at me so long I asked what was the matter, but got Nothing, Scout for ananswer. When we went home, Jem put the dolls in his trunk.

Less than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum, which weenjoyed, the fact that everything on the Radley Place was poison having slipped Jemsmemory.

The following week the knot-hole yielded a tarnished medal. Jem showed it to Atticus,who said it was a spelling medal, that before we were born the Maycomb Countyschools had spelling contests and awarded medals to the winners. Atticus saidsomeone must have lost it, and had we asked around? Jem camel-kicked me when Itried to say where we had found it. Jem asked Atticus if he remembered anybody whoever won one, and Atticus said no.

Our biggest prize appeared four days later. It was a pocket watch that wouldnt run, ona chain with an aluminum knife.

You reckon its white gold, Jem?

Dont know. Ill show it to Atticus.

Atticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars, knife, chain and all, if it were new.

Did you swap with somebody at school? he asked.

Oh, no sir! Jem pulled out his grandfathers watch that Atticus let him carry once aweek if Jem were careful with it. On the days he carried the watch, Jem walked on eggs.

Atticus, if its all right with you, Id rather have this one instead. Maybe I can fix it.

When the new wore off his grandfathers watch, and carrying it became a daysburdensome task, Jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every fiveminutes.

He did a fair job, only one spring and two tiny pieces left over, but the watch would notrun. Oh-h, he sighed, itll never go. Scout?

Huh?

You reckon we oughta write a letter to whoevers leaving us these things?

Thatd be right nice, Jem, we can thank emwhats wrong?

Jem was holding his ears, shaking his head from side to side. I dont get it, I just dontget itI dont know why, Scout He looked toward the livingroom. Ive gotta goodmind to tell Atticusno, I reckon not.

Ill tell him for you.

No, dont do that, Scout. Scout?

Wha-t?

He had been on the verge of telling me something all evening; his face would brightenand he would lean toward me, then he would change his mind. He changed it again.

Oh, nothin.

Here, lets write a letter. I pushed a tablet and pencil under his nose.

Okay. Dear Mister

How do you know its a man? I bet its Miss Maudiebeen bettin that for a longtime.

Ar-r, Miss Maudie cant chew gum Jem broke into a grin. You know, she can talkreal pretty sometimes. One time I asked her to have a chew and she said no thanks,thatchewing gum cleaved to her palate and rendered her speechless, said Jemcarefully. Doesnt that sound nice?

Yeah, she can say nice things sometimes. She wouldnt have a watch and chainanyway.

Dear sir, said Jem. We appreciate theno, we appreciate everything which youhave put into the tree for us. Yours very truly, Jeremy Atticus Finch.

He wont know who you are if you sign it like that, Jem.

Jem erased his name and wrote, Jem Finch. I signed, Jean Louise Finch (Scout),

beneath it. Jem put the note in an envelope.

Next morning on the way to school he ran ahead of me and stopped at the tree. Jemwas facing me when he looked up, and I saw him go stark white.

Scout!

I ran to him.

Someone had filled our knot-hole with cement.

Dont you cry, now, Scout dont cry now, dont you worry- he muttered at me all theway to school.

When we went home for dinner Jem bolted his food, ran to the porch and stood on thesteps. I followed him. Hasnt passed by yet, he said.

Next day Jem repeated his vigil and was rewarded.

Hidy do, Mr. Nathan, he said.

Morning Jem, Scout, said Mr. Radley, as he went by.

Mr. Radley, said Jem.

Mr. Radley turned around.

Mr. Radley, ahdid you put cement in that hole in that tree down yonder?

Yes, he said. I filled it up.

Whyd you do it, sir?

Trees dying. You plug em with cement when theyre sick. You ought to know that,Jem.

Jem said nothing more about it until late afternoon. When we passed our tree he gaveit a meditative pat on its cement, and remained deep in thought. He seemed to beworking himself into a bad humor, so I kept my distance.

As usual, we met Atticus coming home from work that evening. When we were at oursteps Jem said, Atticus, look down yonder at that tree, please sir.

What tree, son?

The one on the corner of the Radley lot comin from school.

Yes?

Is that tree dyin?

Why no, son, I dont think so. Look at the leaves, theyre all green and full, no brownpatches anywhere

It aint even sick?

That trees as healthy as you are, Jem. Why?

Mr. Nathan Radley said it was dyin.

Well maybe it is. Im sure Mr. Radley knows more about his trees than we do.

Atticus left us on the porch. Jem leaned on a pillar, rubbing his shoulders against it.

Do you itch, Jem? I asked as politely as I could. He did not answer. Come on in,Jem, I said.

After while.

He stood there until nightfall, and I waited for him. When we went in the house I sawhe had been crying; his face was dirty in the right places, but I thought it odd that I hadnot heard him.

Chapter 8

For reasons unfathomable to the most experienced prophets in Maycomb County,autumn turned to winter that year. We had two weeks of the coldest weather since 1885,Atticus said. Mr. Avery said it was written on the Rosetta Stone that when childrendisobeyed their parents, smoked cigarettes and made war on each other, the seasonswould change: Jem and I were burdened with the guilt of contributing to the aberrationsof nature, thereby causing unhappiness to our neighbors and discomfort to ourselves.

Old Mrs. Radley died that winter, but her death caused hardly a rippletheneighborhood seldom saw her, except when she watered her cannas. Jem and Idecided that Boo had got her at last, but when Atticus returned from the Radley househe said she died of natural causes, to our disappointment.

Ask him, Jem whispered.

You ask him, youre the oldest.

Thats why you oughta ask him.

Atticus, I said, did you see Mr. Arthur?

Atticus looked sternly around his newspaper at me: I did not.

Jem restrained me from further questions. He said Atticus was still touchous about usand the Radleys and it wouldnt do to push him any. Jem had a notion that Atticusthought our activities that night last summer were not solely confined to strip poker. Jemhad no firm basis for his ideas, he said it was merely a twitch.

Next morning I awoke, looked out the window and nearly died of fright. My screamsbrought Atticus from his bathroom half-shaven.

The worlds endin, Atticus! Please do something! I dragged him to the window andpointed.

No its not, he said. Its snowing.

Jem asked Atticus would it keep up. Jem had never seen snow either, but he knewwhat it was. Atticus said he didnt know any more about snow than Jem did. I think,though, if its watery like that, itll turn to rain.

The telephone rang and Atticus left the breakfast table to answer it. That was EulaMay, he said when he returned. I quoteAs it has not snowed in Maycomb Countysince 1885, there will be no school today.

Eula May was Maycombs leading telephone operator. She was entrusted with issuingpublic announcements, wedding invitations, setting off the fire siren, and giving first-aidinstructions when Dr. Reynolds was away.

When Atticus finally called us to order and bade us look at our plates instead of outthe windows, Jem asked, How do you make a snowman?

I havent the slightest idea, said Atticus. I dont want you all to be disappointed, but Idoubt if therell be enough snow for a snowball, even.

Calpurnia came in and said she thought it was sticking. When we ran to the back yard,it was covered with a feeble layer of soggy snow.

We shouldnt walk about in it, said Jem. Look, every step you takes wasting it.

I looked back at my mushy footprints. Jem said if we waited until it snowed some morewe could scrape it all up for a snowman. I stuck out my tongue and caught a fat flake. Itburned.

Jem, its hot!

No it aint, its so cold it burns. Now dont eat it, Scout, youre wasting it. Let it comedown.

But I want to walk in it.

I know what, we can go walk over at Miss Maudies.

Jem hopped across the front yard. I followed in his tracks. When we were on thesidewalk in front of Miss Maudies, Mr. Avery accosted us. He had a pink face and a bigstomach below his belt.

See what youve done? he said. Hasnt snowed in Maycomb since Appomattox. Itsbad children like you makes the seasons change.

I wondered if Mr. Avery knew how hopefully we had watched last summer for him torepeat his performance, and reflected that if this was our reward, there was somethingto say for sin. I did not wonder where Mr. Avery gathered his meteorological statistics:

they came straight from the Rosetta Stone.

Jem Finch, you Jem Finch!

Miss Maudies callin you, Jem.

You all stay in the middle of the yard. Theres some thrift buried under the snow nearthe porch. Dont step on it!

Yessum! called Jem. Its beautiful, aint it, Miss Maudie?

Beautiful my hind foot! If it freezes tonight itll carry off all my azaleas!

Miss Maudies old sunhat glistened with snow crystals. She was bending over somesmall bushes, wrapping them in burlap bags. Jem asked her what she was doing thatfor.

Keep em warm, she said.

How can flowers keep warm? They dont circulate.

I cannot answer that question, Jem Finch. All I know is if it freezes tonight theseplantsll freeze, so you cover em up. Is that clear?

Yessum. Miss Maudie?

What, sir?

Could Scout and me borrow some of your snow?

Heavens alive, take it all! Theres an old peach basket under the house, haul it off inthat. Miss Maudies eyes narrowed. Jem Finch, what are you going to do with mysnow?

Youll see, said Jem, and we transferred as much snow as we could from MissMaudies yard to ours, a slushy operation.

What are we gonna do, Jem? I asked.

Youll see, he said. Now get the basket and haul all the snow you can rake up fromthe back yard to the front. Walk back in your tracks, though, he cautioned.

Are we gonna have a snow baby, Jem?

No, a real snowman. Gotta work hard, now.

Jem ran to the back yard, produced the garden hoe and began digging quickly behindthe woodpile, placing any worms he found to one side. He went in the house, returnedwith the laundry hamper, filled it with earth and carried it to the front yard.

When we had five baskets of earth and two baskets of snow, Jem said we were readyto begin.

Dont you think this is kind of a mess? I asked.

Looks messy now, but it wont later, he said.

Jem scooped up an armful of dirt, patted it into a mound on which he added anotherload, and another until he had constructed a torso.

Jem, I aint ever heard of a nigger snowman, I said.

He wont be black long, he grunted.

Jem procured some peachtree switches from the back yard, plaited them, and bentthem into bones to be covered with dirt.

He looks like Stephanie Crawford with her hands on her hips, I said. Fat in themiddle and little-bitty arms.

Ill make em bigger. Jem sloshed water over the mud man and added more dirt. Helooked thoughtfully at it for a moment, then he molded a big stomach below the figureswaistline. Jem glanced at me, his eyes twinkling: Mr. Averys sort of shaped like asnowman, aint he?

Jem scooped up some snow and began plastering it on. He permitted me to coveronly the back, saving the public parts for himself. Gradually Mr. Avery turned white.

Using bits of wood for eyes, nose, mouth, and buttons, Jem succeeded in making Mr.

Avery look cross. A stick of stovewood completed the picture. Jem stepped back andviewed his creation.

Its lovely, Jem, I said. Looks almost like hed talk to you.

It is, aint it? he said shyly.

We could not wait for Atticus to come home for dinner, but called and said we had abig surprise for him. He seemed surprised when he saw most of the back yard in thefront yard, but he said we had done a jim-dandy job. I didnt know how you were goingto do it, he said to Jem, but from now on Ill never worry about whatll become of you,son, youll always have an idea.

Jems ears reddened from Atticuss compliment, but he looked up sharply when hesaw Atticus stepping back. Atticus squinted at the snowman a while. He grinned, thenlaughed. Son, I cant tell what youre going to bean engineer, a lawyer, or a portraitpainter. Youve perpetrated a near libel here in the front yard. Weve got to disguise thisfellow.

Atticus suggested that Jem hone down his creations front a little, swap a broom forthe stovewood, and put an apron on him.

Jem explained that if he did, the snowman would become muddy and cease to be asnowman.

I dont care what you do, so long as you do something, said Atticus. You cant goaround making caricatures of the neighbors.

Aint a characterture, said Jem. It looks just like him.

Mr. Avery might not think so.

I know what! said Jem. He raced across the street, disappeared into Miss Maudiesback yard and returned triumphant. He stuck her sunhat on the snowmans head andjammed her hedge-clippers into the crook of his arm. Atticus said that would be fine.

Miss Maudie opened her front door and came out on the porch. She looked across thestreet at us. Suddenly she grinned. Jem Finch, she called. You devil, bring me backmy hat, sir!

Jem looked up at Atticus, who shook his head. Shes just fussing, he said. Shesreally impressed with youraccomplishments.

Atticus strolled over to Miss Maudies sidewalk, where they engaged in an arm-wavingconversation, the only phrase of which I caught was erected an absolute morphoditein that yard! Atticus, youll never raise em!

The snow stopped in the afternoon, the temperature dropped, and by nightfall Mr.

Averys direst predictions came true: Calpurnia kept every fireplace in the house blazing,but we were cold. When Atticus came home that evening he said we were in for it, andasked Calpurnia if she wanted to stay with us for the night. Calpurnia glanced up at thehigh ceilings and long windows and said she thought shed be warmer at her house.

Atticus drove her home in the car.

Before I went to sleep Atticus put more coal on the fire in my room. He said thethermometer registered sixteen, that it was the coldest night in his memory, and that oursnowman outside was frozen solid.

Minutes later, it seemed, I was awakened by someone shaking me. Atticuss overcoatwas spread across me. Is it morning already?

Baby, get up.

Atticus was holding out my bathrobe and coat. Put your robe on first, he said.

Jem was standing beside Atticus, groggy and tousled. He was holding his overcoatclosed at the neck, his other hand was jammed into his pocket. He looked strangelyoverweight.

Hurry, hon, said Atticus. Herere your shoes and socks.

Stupidly, I put them on. Is it morning?

No, its a little after one. Hurry now.

That something was wrong finally got through to me. Whats the matter?

By then he did not have to tell me. Just as the birds know where to go when it rains, Iknew when there was trouble in our street. Soft taffeta-like sounds and muffled scurryingsounds filled me with helpless dread.

Whose is it?

Miss Maudies, hon, said Atticus gently.

At the front door, we saw fire spewing from Miss Maudies diningroom windows. As ifto confirm what we saw, the town fire siren wailed up the scale to a treble pitch andremained there, screaming.

Its gone, aint it? moaned Jem.

I expect so, said Atticus. Now listen, both of you. Go down and stand in front of theRadley Place. Keep out of the way, do you hear? See which way the winds blowing?

Oh, said Jem. Atticus, reckon we oughta start moving the furniture out?

Not yet, son. Do as I tell you. Run now. Take care of Scout, you hear? Dont let herout of your sight.

With a push, Atticus started us toward the Radley front gate. We stood watching thestreet fill with men and cars while fire silently devoured Miss Maudies house. Why dontthey hurry, why dont they hurry muttered Jem.

We saw why. The old fire truck, killed by the cold, was being pushed from town by acrowd of men. When the men attached its hose to a hydrant, the hose burst and watershot up, tinkling down on the pavement.

Oh-h Lord, Jem

Jem put his arm around me. Hush, Scout, he said. It aint time to worry yet. Ill letyou know when.

The men of Maycomb, in all degrees of dress and undress, took furniture from MissMaudies house to a yard across the street. I saw Atticus carrying Miss Maudies heavyoak rocking chair, and thought it sensible of him to save what she valued most.

Sometimes we heard shouts. Then Mr. Averys face appeared in an upstairs window.

He pushed a mattress out the window into the street and threw down furniture until menshouted, Come down from there, Dick! The stairs are going! Get outta there, Mr.

Avery!

Mr. Avery began climbing through the window.

Scout, hes stuck breathed Jem. Oh God

Mr. Avery was wedged tightly. I buried my head under Jems arm and didnt look againuntil Jem cried, Hes got loose, Scout! Hes all right!

I looked up to see Mr. Avery cross the upstairs porch. He swung his legs over therailing and was sliding down a pillar when he slipped. He fell, yelled, and hit MissMaudies shrubbery.

Suddenly I noticed that the men were backing away from Miss Maudies house,moving down the street toward us. They were no longer carrying furniture. The fire waswell into the second floor and had eaten its way to the roof: window frames were blackagainst a vivid orange center.

Jem, it looks like a pumpkin

Scout, look!

Smoke was rolling off our house and Miss Rachels house like fog off a riverbank, andmen were pulling hoses toward them. Behind us, the fire truck from Abbottsvillescreamed around the curve and stopped in front of our house.

That book I said.

What? said Jem.

That Tom Swift book, it aint mine, its Dills

Dont worry, Scout, it aint time to worry yet, said Jem. He pointed. Looka yonder.

In a group of neighbors, Atticus was standing with his hands in his overcoat pockets.

He might have been watching a football game. Miss Maudie was beside him.

See there, hes not worried yet, said Jem.

Why aint he on top of one of the houses?

Hes too old, hed break his neck.

You think we oughta make him get our stuff out?

Lets dont pester him, hell know when its time, said Jem.

The Abbottsville fire truck began pumping water on our house; a man on the roofpointed to places that needed it most. I watched our Absolute Morphodite go black andcrumble; Miss Maudies sunhat settled on top of the heap. I could not see her hedge-clippers. In the heat between our house, Miss Rachels and Miss Maudies, the men hadlong ago shed coats and bathrobes. They worked in pajama tops and nightshirts stuffedinto their pants, but I became aware that I was slowly freezing where I stood. Jem triedto keep me warm, but his arm was not enough. I pulled free of it and clutched myshoulders. By dancing a little, I could feel my feet.

Another fire truck appeared and stopped in front of Miss Stephanie Crawfords. Therewas no hydrant for another hose, and the men tried to soak her house with handextinguishers.

Miss Maudies tin roof quelled the flames. Roaring, the house collapsed; fire gushedeverywhere, followed by a flurry of blankets from men on top of the adjacent houses,beating out sparks and burning chunks of wood.

It was dawn before the men began to leave, first one by one, then in groups. Theypushed the Maycomb fire truck back to town, the Abbottsville truck departed, the thirdone remained. We found out next day it had come from Clarks Ferry, sixty miles away.

Jem and I slid across the street. Miss Maudie was staring at the smoking black hole inher yard, and Atticus shook his head to tell us she did not want to talk. He led us home,holding onto our shoulders to cross the icy street. He said Miss Maudie would stay withMiss Stephanie for the time being.

Anybody want some hot chocolate? he asked. I shuddered when Atticus started afire in the kitchen stove.

As we drank our cocoa I noticed Atticus looking at me, first with curiosity, then withsternness. I thought I told you and Jem to stay put, he said.

Why, we did. We stayed

Then whose blanket is that?

Blanket?

Yes maam, blanket. It isnt ours.

I looked down and found myself clutching a brown woolen blanket I was wearingaround my shoulders, squaw-fashion.

Atticus, I dont know, sir I

I turned to Jem for an answer, but Jem was even more bewildered than I. He said hedidnt know how it got there, we did exactly as Atticus had told us, we stood down by theRadley gate away from everybody, we didnt move an inchJem stopped.

Mr. Nathan was at the fire, he babbled, I saw him, I saw him, he was tuggin thatmattressAtticus, I swear

Thats all right, son. Atticus grinned slowly. Looks like all of Maycomb was outtonight, in one way or another. Jem, theres some wrapping paper in the pantry, I think.

Go get it and well

Atticus, no sir!

Jem seemed to have lost his mind. He began pouring out our secrets right and left intotal disregard for my safety if not for his own, omitting nothing, knot-hole, pants and all.

Mr. Nathan put cement in that tree, Atticus, an he did it to stop us findin thingshes crazy, I reckon, like they say, but Atticus, I swear to God he aint ever harmed us,he aint ever hurt us, he coulda cut my throat from ear to ear that night but he tried tomend my pants instead he aint ever hurt us, Atticus

Atticus said, Whoa, son, so gently that I was greatly heartened. It was obvious thathe had not followed a word Jem said, for all Atticus said was, Youre right. Wed betterkeep this and the blanket to ourselves. Someday, maybe, Scout can thank him forcovering her up.

Thank who? I asked.

Boo Radley. You were so busy looking at the fire you didnt know it when he put theblanket around you.

My stomach turned to water and I nearly threw up when Jem held out the blanket andcrept toward me. He sneaked out of the houseturn roundsneaked up, an went likethis!

Atticus said dryly, Do not let this inspire you to further glory, Jeremy.

Jem scowled, I aint gonna do anything to him, but I watched the spark of freshadventure leave his eyes. Just think, Scout, he said, if youd just turned around,youda seen him.

Calpurnia woke us at noon. Atticus had said we need not go to school that day, wedlearn nothing after no sleep. Calpurnia said for us to try and clean up the front yard.

Miss Maudies sunhat was suspended in a thin layer of ice, like a fly in amber, and wehad to dig under the dirt for her hedge-clippers. We found her in her back yard, gazingat her frozen charred azaleas. Were bringing back your things, Miss Maudie, saidJem. Were awful sorry.

Miss Maudie looked around, and the shadow of her old grin crossed her face. Alwayswanted a smaller house, Jem Finch. Gives me more yard. Just think, Ill have moreroom for my azaleas now!

You aint grievin, Miss Maudie? I asked, surprised. Atticus said her house wasnearly all she had.

Grieving, child? Why, I hated that old cow barn. Thought of settin fire to it a hundredtimes myself, except theyd lock me up.

But

Dont you worry about me, Jean Louise Finch. There are ways of doing things youdont know about. Why, Ill build me a little house and take me a couple of roomersandgracious, Ill have the finest yard in Alabama. Those Bellingrathsll look plain punywhen I get started!

Jem and I looked at each other. Howd it catch, Miss Maudie? he asked.

I dont know, Jem. Probably the flue in the kitchen. I kept a fire in there last night formy potted plants. Hear you had some unexpected company last night, Miss JeanLouise.

Howd you know?

Atticus told me on his way to town this morning. Tell you the truth, Id like tove beenwith you. And Idve had sense enough to turn around, too.

Miss Maudie puzzled me. With most of her possessions gone and her beloved yard ashambles, she still took a lively and cordial interest in Jems and my affairs.

She must have seen my perplexity. She said, Only thing I worried about last nightwas all the danger and commotion it caused. This whole neighborhood could have goneup. Mr. Averyll be in bed for a weekhes right stove up. Hes too old to do things likethat and I told him so. Soon as I can get my hands clean and when StephanieCrawfords not looking, Ill make him a Lane cake. That Stephanies been after myrecipe for thirty years, and if she thinks Ill give it to her just because Im staying with hershes got another think coming.

I reflected that if Miss Maudie broke down and gave it to her, Miss Stephanie couldntfollow it anyway. Miss Maudie had once let me see it: among other things, the recipecalled for one large cup of sugar.

It was a still day. The air was so cold and clear we heard the courthouse clock clank,rattle and strain before it struck the hour. Miss Maudies nose was a color I had neverseen before, and I inquired about it.

Ive been out here since six oclock, she said. Should be frozen by now. She heldup her hands. A network of tiny lines crisscrossed her palms, brown with dirt and driedblood.

Youve ruined em, said Jem. Why dont you get a colored man? There was no noteof sacrifice in his voice when he added, Or Scoutnme, we can help you.

Miss Maudie said, Thank you sir, but youve got a job of your own over there. Shepointed to our yard.

You mean the Morphodite? I asked. Shoot, we can rake him up in a jiffy.

Miss Maudie stared down at me, her lips moving silently. Suddenly she put her handsto her head and whooped. When we left her, she was still chuckling.

Jem said he didnt know what was the matter with herthat was just Miss Maudie.


Chapter 9

You can just take that back, boy!

This order, given by me to Cecil Jacobs, was the beginning of a rather thin time forJem and me. My fists were clenched and I was ready to let fly. Atticus had promised mehe would wear me out if he ever heard of me fighting any more; I was far too old and toobig for such childish things, and the sooner I learned to hold in, the better off everybodywould be. I soon forgot.

Cecil Jacobs made me forget. He had announced in the schoolyard the day beforethat Scout Finchs daddy defended niggers. I denied it, but told Jem.

Whatd he mean sayin that? I asked.

Nothing, Jem said. Ask Atticus, hell tell you.

Do you defend niggers, Atticus? I asked him that evening.

Of course I do. Dont say nigger, Scout. Thats common.

s what everybody at school says.

From now on itll be everybody less one

Well if you dont want me to grow up talkin that way, why do you send me to school?

My father looked at me mildly, amusement in his eyes. Despite our compromise, mycampaign to avoid school had continued in one form or another since my first daysdose of it: the beginning of last September had brought on sinking spells, dizziness, andmild gastric complaints. I went so far as to pay a nickel for the privilege of rubbing myhead against the head of Miss Rachels cooks son, who was afflicted with a tremendousringworm. It didnt take.

But I was worrying another bone. Do all lawyers defend n-Negroes, Atticus?

Of course they do, Scout.

Then why did Cecil say you defended niggers? He made it sound like you wererunnin a still.

Atticus sighed. Im simply defending a Negrohis names Tom Robinson. He lives inthat little settlement beyond the town dump. Hes a member of Calpurnias church, andCal knows his family well. She says theyre clean-living folks. Scout, you arent oldenough to understand some things yet, but theres been some high talk around town tothe effect that I shouldnt do much about defending this man. Its a peculiar caseitwont come to trial until summer session. John Taylor was kind enough to give us apostponement

If you shouldnt be defendin him, then why are you doin it?

For a number of reasons, said Atticus. The main one is, if I didnt I couldnt hold upmy head in town, I couldnt represent this county in the legislature, I couldnt even tellyou or Jem not to do something again.

You mean if you didnt defend that man, Jem and me wouldnt have to mind you anymore?

Thats about right.

Why?

Because I could never ask you to mind me again. Scout, simply by the nature of thework, every lawyer gets at least one case in his lifetime that affects him personally. Thisones mine, I guess. You might hear some ugly talk about it at school, but do one thingfor me if you will: you just hold your head high and keep those fists down. No matterwhat anybody says to you, dont you let em get your goat. Try fighting with your headfor a change its a good one, even if it does resist learning.

Atticus, are we going to win it?

No, honey.

Then why

Simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for usnot to try to win, Atticus said.

You sound like Cousin Ike Finch, I said. Cousin Ike Finch was Maycomb Countyssole surviving Confederate veteran. He wore a General Hood type beard of which hewas inordinately vain. At least once a year Atticus, Jem and I called on him, and I wouldhave to kiss him. It was horrible. Jem and I would listen respectfully to Atticus andCousin Ike rehash the war. Tell you, Atticus, Cousin Ike would say, the MissouriCompromise was what licked us, but if I had to go through it agin Id walk every step ofthe way there an every step back jist like I did before an furthermore wed whip em thistime now in 1864, when Stonewall Jackson came around byI beg your pardon,young folks. Ol Blue Light was in heaven then, God rest his saintly brow

Come here, Scout, said Atticus. I crawled into his lap and tucked my head under hischin. He put his arms around me and rocked me gently. Its different this time, he said.

This time we arent fighting the Yankees, were fighting our friends. But remember this,no matter how bitter things get, theyre still our friends and this is still our home.

With this in mind, I faced Cecil Jacobs in the schoolyard next day: You gonna takethat back, boy?

You gotta make me first! he yelled. My folks said your daddy was a disgrace an thatnigger oughta hang from the water-tank!

I drew a bead on him, remembered what Atticus had said, then dropped my fists andwalked away, Scouts a cowward! ringing in my ears. It was the first time I everwalked away from a fight.

Somehow, if I fought Cecil I would let Atticus down. Atticus so rarely asked Jem andme to do something for him, I could take being called a coward for him. I felt extremelynoble for having remembered, and remained noble for three weeks. Then Christmascame and disaster struck.

Jem and I viewed Christmas with mixed feelings. The good side was the tree andUncle Jack Finch. Every Christmas Eve day we met Uncle Jack at Maycomb Junction,and he would spend a week with us.

A flip of the coin revealed the uncompromising lineaments of Aunt Alexandra andFrancis.

I suppose I should include Uncle Jimmy, Aunt Alexandras husband, but as he neverspoke a word to me in my life except to say, Get off the fence, once, I never saw anyreason to take notice of him. Neither did Aunt Alexandra. Long ago, in a burst offriendliness, Aunty and Uncle Jimmy produced a son named Henry, who left home assoon as was humanly possible, married, and produced Francis. Henry and his wifedeposited Francis at his grandparents every Christmas, then pursued their ownpleasures.

No amount of sighing could induce Atticus to let us spend Christmas day at home. Wewent to Finchs Landing every Christmas in my memory. The fact that Aunty was a goodcook was some compensation for being forced to spend a religious holiday with FrancisHancock. He was a year older than I, and I avoided him on principle: he enjoyedeverything I disapproved of, and disliked my ingenuous diversions.

Aunt Alexandra was Atticuss sister, but when Jem told me about changelings andsiblings, I decided that she had been swapped at birth, that my grandparents hadperhaps received a Crawford instead of a Finch. Had I ever harbored the mysticalnotions about mountains that seem to obsess lawyers and judges, Aunt Alexandrawould have been analogous to Mount Everest: throughout my early life, she was coldand there.

When Uncle Jack jumped down from the train Christmas Eve day, we had to wait forthe porter to hand him two long packages. Jem and I always thought it funny whenUncle Jack pecked Atticus on the cheek; they were the only two men we ever saw kisseach other. Uncle Jack shook hands with Jem and swung me high, but not high enough:

Uncle Jack was a head shorter than Atticus; the baby of the family, he was younger thanAunt Alexandra. He and Aunty looked alike, but Uncle Jack made better use of his face:

we were never wary of his sharp nose and chin.

He was one of the few men of science who never terrified me, probably because henever behaved like a doctor. Whenever he performed a minor service for Jem and me,as removing a splinter from a foot, he would tell us exactly what he was going to do,give us an estimation of how much it would hurt, and explain the use of any tongs heemployed. One Christmas I lurked in corners nursing a twisted splinter in my foot,permitting no one to come near me. When Uncle Jack caught me, he kept me laughingabout a preacher who hated going to church so much that every day he stood at hisgate in his dressing-gown, smoking a hookah and delivering five-minute sermons to anypassers-by who desired spiritual comfort. I interrupted to make Uncle Jack let me knowwhen he would pull it out, but he held up a bloody splinter in a pair of tweezers and saidhe yanked it while I was laughing, that was what was known as relativity.

Whats in those packages? I asked him, pointing to the long thin parcels the porterhad given him.

None of your business, he said.

Jem said, Hows Rose Aylmer?

Rose Aylmer was Uncle Jacks cat. She was a beautiful yellow female Uncle Jack saidwas one of the few women he could stand permanently. He reached into his coat pocketand brought out some snapshots. We admired them.

Shes gettin fat, I said.

I should think so. She eats all the leftover fingers and ears from the hospital.

Aw, thats a damn story, I said.

I beg your pardon?

Atticus said, Dont pay any attention to her, Jack. Shes trying you out. Cal says shesbeen cussing fluently for a week, now. Uncle Jack raised his eyebrows and saidnothing. I was proceeding on the dim theory, aside from the innate attractiveness ofsuch words, that if Atticus discovered I had picked them up at school he wouldnt makeme go.

But at supper that evening when I asked him to pass the damn ham, please, UncleJack pointed at me. See me afterwards, young lady, he said.

When supper was over, Uncle Jack went to the livingroom and sat down. He slappedhis thighs for me to come sit on his lap. I liked to smell him: he was like a bottle ofalcohol and something pleasantly sweet. He pushed back my bangs and looked at me.

Youre more like Atticus than your mother, he said. Youre also growing out of yourpants a little.

I reckon they fit all right.

You like words like damn and hell now, dont you?

I said I reckoned so.

Well I dont, said Uncle Jack, not unless theres extreme provocation connected withem. Ill be here a week, and I dont want to hear any words like that while Im here.

Scout, youll get in trouble if you go around saying things like that. You want to grow upto be a lady, dont you?

I said not particularly.

Of course you do. Now lets get to the tree.

We decorated the tree until bedtime, and that night I dreamed of the two longpackages for Jem and me. Next morning Jem and I dived for them: they were fromAtticus, who had written Uncle Jack to get them for us, and they were what we hadasked for.

Dont point them in the house, said Atticus, when Jem aimed at a picture on the wall.

Youll have to teach em to shoot, said Uncle Jack.

Thats your job, said Atticus. I merely bowed to the inevitable.

It took Atticuss courtroom voice to drag us away from the tree. He declined to let ustake our air rifles to the Landing (I had already begun to think of shooting Francis) andsaid if we made one false move hed take them away from us for good.

Finchs Landing consisted of three hundred and sixty-six steps down a high bluff andending in a jetty. Farther down stream, beyond the bluff, were traces of an old cottonlanding, where Finch Negroes had loaded bales and produce, unloaded blocks of ice,flour and sugar, farm equipment, and feminine apparel. A two-rut road ran from theriverside and vanished among dark trees. At the end of the road was a two-storied whitehouse with porches circling it upstairs and downstairs. In his old age, our ancestorSimon Finch had built it to please his nagging wife; but with the porches all resemblanceto ordinary houses of its era ended. The internal arrangements of the Finch house wereindicative of Simons guilelessness and the absolute trust with which he regarded hisoffspring.

There were six bedrooms upstairs, four for the eight female children, one for WelcomeFinch, the sole son, and one for visiting relatives. Simple enough; but the daughters

rooms could be reached only by one staircase, Welcomes room and the guestroomonly by another. The Daughters Staircase was in the ground-floor bedroom of theirparents, so Simon always knew the hours of his daughters nocturnal comings andgoings.

There was a kitchen separate from the rest of the house, tacked onto it by a woodencatwalk; in the back yard was a rusty bell on a pole, used to summon field hands or as adistress signal; a widows walk was on the roof, but no widows walked therefrom it,Simon oversaw his overseer, watched the river-boats, and gazed into the lives ofsurrounding landholders.

There went with the house the usual legend about the Yankees: one Finch female,recently engaged, donned her complete trousseau to save it from raiders in theneighborhood; she became stuck in the door to the Daughters Staircase but wasdoused with water and finally pushed through. When we arrived at the Landing, AuntAlexandra kissed Uncle Jack, Francis kissed Uncle Jack, Uncle Jimmy shook handssilently with Uncle Jack, Jem and I gave our presents to Francis, who gave us a present.

Jem felt his age and gravitated to the adults, leaving me to entertain our cousin. Franciswas eight and slicked back his hair.

Whatd you get for Christmas? I asked politely.

Just what I asked for, he said. Francis had requested a pair of knee-pants, a redleather booksack, five shirts and an untied bow tie.

Thats nice, I lied. Jem and me got air rifles, and Jem got a chemistry set

A toy one, I reckon.

No, a real one. Hes gonna make me some invisible ink, and Im gonna write to Dill init.

Francis asked what was the use of that.

Well, cant you just see his face when he gets a letter from me with nothing in it? Itlldrive him nuts.

Talking to Francis gave me the sensation of settling slowly to the bottom of the ocean.

He was the most boring child I ever met. As he lived in Mobile, he could not inform onme to school authorities, but he managed to tell everything he knew to Aunt Alexandra,who in turn unburdened herself to Atticus, who either forgot it or gave me hell,whichever struck his fancy. But the only time I ever heard Atticus speak sharply toanyone was when I once heard him say, Sister, I do the best I can with them! It hadsomething to do with my going around in overalls.

Aunt Alexandra was fanatical on the subject of my attire. I could not possibly hope tobe a lady if I wore breeches; when I said I could do nothing in a dress, she said I wasntsupposed to be doing things that required pants. Aunt Alexandras vision of mydeportment involved playing with small stoves, tea sets, and wearing the Add-A-Pearlnecklace she gave me when I was born; furthermore, I should be a ray of sunshine inmy fathers lonely life. I suggested that one could be a ray of sunshine in pants just aswell, but Aunty said that one had to behave like a sunbeam, that I was born good buthad grown progressively worse every year. She hurt my feelings and set my teethpermanently on edge, but when I asked Atticus about it, he said there were alreadyenough sunbeams in the family and to go on about my business, he didnt mind memuch the way I was.

At Christmas dinner, I sat at the little table in the diningroom; Jem and Francis sat withthe adults at the dining table. Aunty had continued to isolate me long after Jem andFrancis graduated to the big table. I often wondered what she thought Id do, get up andthrow something? I sometimes thought of asking her if she would let me sit at the bigtable with the rest of them just once, I would prove to her how civilized I could be; afterall, I ate at home every day with no major mishaps. When I begged Atticus to use hisinfluence, he said he had nonewe were guests, and we sat where she told us to sit.

He also said Aunt Alexandra didnt understand girls much, shed never had one.

But her cooking made up for everything: three kinds of meat, summer vegetables fromher pantry shelves; peach pickles, two kinds of cake and ambrosia constituted a modestChristmas dinner. Afterwards, the adults made for the livingroom and sat around in adazed condition. Jem lay on the floor, and I went to the back yard. Put on your coat,

said Atticus dreamily, so I didnt hear him.

Francis sat beside me on the back steps. That was the best yet, I said.

Grandmas a wonderful cook, said Francis. Shes gonna teach me how.

Boys dont cook. I giggled at the thought of Jem in an apron.

Grandma says all men should learn to cook, that men oughta be careful with theirwives and wait on em when they dont feel good, said my cousin.

I dont want Dill waitin on me, I said. Id rather wait on him.

Dill?

Yeah. Dont say anything about it yet, but were gonna get married as soon as werebig enough. He asked me last summer.

Francis hooted.

Whats the matter with him? I asked. Aint anything the matter with him.

You mean that little runt Grandma says stays with Miss Rachel every summer?

Thats exactly who I mean.

I know all about him, said Francis.

What about him?

Grandma says he hasnt got a home

Has too, he lives in Meridian.

he just gets passed around from relative to relative, and Miss Rachel keeps himevery summer.

Francis, thats not so!

Francis grinned at me. Youre mighty dumb sometimes, Jean Louise. Guess youdont know any better, though.

What do you mean?

If Uncle Atticus lets you run around with stray dogs, thats his own business, likeGrandma says, so it aint your fault. I guess it aint your fault if Uncle Atticus is a nigger-lover besides, but Im here to tell you it certainly does mortify the rest of the family

Francis, what the hell do you mean?

Just what I said. Grandma says its bad enough he lets you all run wild, but now hesturned out a nigger-lover well never be able to walk the streets of Maycomb agin. Hesruinin the family, thats what hes doin.

Francis rose and sprinted down the catwalk to the old kitchen. At a safe distance hecalled, Hes nothin but a nigger-lover!

He is not! I roared. I dont know what youre talkin about, but you better cut it outthis red hot minute!

I leaped off the steps and ran down the catwalk. It was easy to collar Francis. I saidtake it back quick.

Francis jerked loose and sped into the old kitchen. Nigger-lover! he yelled.

When stalking ones prey, it is best to take ones time. Say nothing, and as sure aseggs he will become curious and emerge. Francis appeared at the kitchen door. Youstill mad, Jean Louise? he asked tentatively.

Nothing to speak of, I said.

Francis came out on the catwalk.

You gonna take it back, Fraancis? But I was too quick on the draw. Francis shotback into the kitchen, so I retired to the steps. I could wait patiently. I had sat thereperhaps five minutes when I heard Aunt Alexandra speak: Wheres Francis?

Hes out yonder in the kitchen.

He knows hes not supposed to play in there.

Francis came to the door and yelled, Grandma, shes got me in here and she wontlet me out!

What is all this, Jean Louise?

I looked up at Aunt Alexandra. I havent got him in there, Aunty, I aint holdin him.

Yes she is, shouted Francis, she wont let me out!

Have you all been fussing?

Jean Louise got mad at me, Grandma, called Francis.

Francis, come out of there! Jean Louise, if I hear another word out of you Ill tell yourfather. Did I hear you say hell a while ago?

Nome.

I thought I did. Id better not hear it again.

Aunt Alexandra was a back-porch listener. The moment she was out of sight Franciscame out head up and grinning. Dont you fool with me, he said.

He jumped into the yard and kept his distance, kicking tufts of grass, turning aroundoccasionally to smile at me. Jem appeared on the porch, looked at us, and went away.

Francis climbed the mimosa tree, came down, put his hands in his pockets and strolledaround the yard. Hah! he said. I asked him who he thought he was, Uncle Jack?

Francis said he reckoned I got told, for me to just sit there and leave him alone.

I aint botherin you, I said.

Francis looked at me carefully, concluded that I had been sufficiently subdued, andcrooned softly, Nigger-lover

This time, I split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth. My left impaired, I sailed inwith my right, but not for long. Uncle Jack pinned my arms to my sides and said, Standstill!

Aunt Alexandra ministered to Francis, wiping his tears away with her handkerchief,rubbing his hair, patting his cheek. Atticus, Jem, and Uncle Jimmy had come to the backporch when Francis started yelling.

Who started this? said Uncle Jack.

Francis and I pointed at each other. Grandma, he bawled, she called me a whore-lady and jumped on me!

Is that true, Scout? said Uncle Jack.

I reckon so.

When Uncle Jack looked down at me, his features were like Aunt Alexandras. Youknow I told you youd get in trouble if you used words like that? I told you, didnt I?

Yes sir, but

Well, youre in trouble now. Stay there.

I was debating whether to stand there or run, and tarried in indecision a moment toolong: I turned to flee but Uncle Jack was quicker. I found myself suddenly looking at atiny ant struggling with a bread crumb in the grass.

Ill never speak to you again as long as I live! I hate you an despise you an hope youdie tomorrow! A statement that seemed to encourage Uncle Jack, more than anything. Iran to Atticus for comfort, but he said I had it coming and it was high time we wenthome. I climbed into the back seat of the car without saying good-bye to anyone, and athome I ran to my room and slammed the door. Jem tried to say something nice, but Iwouldnt let him.

When I surveyed the damage there were only seven or eight red marks, and I wasreflecting upon relativity when someone knocked on the door. I asked who it was; UncleJack answered.

Go away!

Uncle Jack said if I talked like that hed lick me again, so I was quiet. When he enteredthe room I retreated to a corner and turned my back on him. Scout, he said, do youstill hate me?

Go on, please sir.

Why, I didnt think youd hold it against me, he said. Im disappointed in youyouhad that coming and you know it.

Didnt either.

Honey, you cant go around calling people

You aint fair, I said, you aint fair.

Uncle Jacks eyebrows went up. Not fair? How not?

Youre real nice, Uncle Jack, an I reckon I love you even after what you did, but youdont understand children much.

Uncle Jack put his hands on his hips and looked down at me. And why do I notunderstand children, Miss Jean Louise? Such conduct as yours required littleunderstanding. It was obstreperous, disorderly and abusive

You gonna give me a chance to tell you? I dont mean to sass you, Im just tryin totell you.

Uncle Jack sat down on the bed. His eyebrows came together, and he peered up atme from under them. Proceed, he said.

I took a deep breath. Well, in the first place you never stopped to gimme a chance totell you my side of ityou just lit right into me. When Jem an I fuss Atticus doesnt everjust listen to Jems side of it, he hears mine too, an in the second place you told menever to use words like that except in ex-extreme provocation, and Francis provocatedme enough to knock his block off

Uncle Jack scratched his head. What was your side of it, Scout?

Francis called Atticus somethin, an I wasnt about to take it off him.

What did Francis call him?

A nigger-lover. I aint very sure what it means, but the way Francis said ittell youone thing right now, Uncle Jack, Ill beI swear before God if Ill sit there and let himsay somethin about Atticus.

He called Atticus that?

Yes sir, he did, an a lot more. Said Atticusd be the ruination of the family an he letJem an me run wild

From the look on Uncle Jacks face, I thought I was in for it again. When he said,Well see about this, I knew Francis was in for it. Ive a good mind to go out theretonight.

Please sir, just let it go. Please.

Ive no intention of letting it go, he said. Alexandra should know about this. The ideaofwaitll I get my hands on that boy

Uncle Jack, please promise me somethin, please sir. Promise you wont tell Atticusabout this. Hehe asked me one time not to let anything I heard about him make memad, an Id ruther him think we were fightin about somethin else instead. Pleasepromise

But I dont like Francis getting away with something like that

He didnt. You reckon you could tie up my hand? Its still bleedin some.

Of course I will, baby. I know of no hand I would be more delighted to tie up. Will youcome this way?

Uncle Jack gallantly bowed me to the bathroom. While he cleaned and bandaged myknuckles, he entertained me with a tale about a funny nearsighted old gentleman whohad a cat named Hodge, and who counted all the cracks in the sidewalk when he wentto town. There now, he said. Youll have a very unladylike scar on your wedding-ringfinger.

Thank you sir. Uncle Jack?

Maam?

Whats a whore-lady?

Uncle Jack plunged into another long tale about an old Prime Minister who sat in theHouse of Commons and blew feathers in the air and tried to keep them there when allabout him men were losing their heads. I guess he was trying to answer my question,but he made no sense whatsoever.

Later, when I was supposed to be in bed, I went down the hall for a drink of water andheard Atticus and Uncle Jack in the livingroom:

I shall never marry, Atticus.

Why?

I might have children.

Atticus said, Youve a lot to learn, Jack.

I know. Your daughter gave me my first lessons this afternoon. She said I didntunderstand children much and told me why. She was quite right. Atticus, she told mehow I should have treated heroh dear, Im so sorry I romped on her.

Atticus chuckled. She earned it, so dont feel too remorseful.

I waited, on tenterhooks, for Uncle Jack to tell Atticus my side of it. But he didnt. Hesimply murmured, Her use of bathroom invective leaves nothing to the imagination. Butshe doesnt know the meaning of half she saysshe asked me what a whore-ladywas

Did you tell her?

No, I told her about Lord Melbourne.

Jack! When a child asks you something, answer him, for goodness sake. But dontmake a production of it. Children are children, but they can spot an evasion quicker thanadults, and evasion simply muddles em. No, my father mused, you had the rightanswer this afternoon, but the wrong reasons. Bad language is a stage all children gothrough, and it dies with time when they learn theyre not attracting attention with it.

Hotheadedness isnt. Scouts got to learn to keep her head and learn soon, with whatsin store for her these next few months. Shes coming along, though. Jems getting olderand she follows his example a good bit now. All she needs is assistance sometimes.

Atticus, youve never laid a hand on her.

I admit that. So far Ive been able to get by with threats. Jack, she minds me as wellas she can. Doesnt come up to scratch half the time, but she tries.

Thats not the answer, said Uncle Jack.

No, the answer is she knows I know she tries. Thats what makes the difference.

What bothers me is that she and Jem will have to absorb some ugly things pretty soon.

Im not worried about Jem keeping his head, but Scoutd just as soon jump on someoneas look at him if her prides at stake

I waited for Uncle Jack to break his promise. He still didnt.

Atticus, how bad is this going to be? You havent had too much chance to discuss it.

It couldnt be worse, Jack. The only thing weve got is a black mans word against theEwells. The evidence boils down to you-didI-didnt. The jury couldnt possibly beexpected to take Tom Robinsons word against the Ewellsare you acquainted with theEwells?

Uncle Jack said yes, he remembered them. He described them to Atticus, but Atticussaid, Youre a generation off. The present ones are the same, though.

What are you going to do, then?

Before Im through, I intend to jar the jury a bitI think well have a reasonablechance on appeal, though. I really cant tell at this stage, Jack. You know, Id hoped toget through life without a case of this kind, but John Taylor pointed at me and said,Youre It.

Let this cup pass from you, eh?

Right. But do you think I could face my children otherwise? You know whats going tohappen as well as I do, Jack, and I hope and pray I can get Jem and Scout through itwithout bitterness, and most of all, without catching Maycombs usual disease. Whyreasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a Negro comes up, issomething I dont pretend to understand I just hope that Jem and Scout come to mefor their answers instead of listening to the town. I hope they trust me enough JeanLouise?

My scalp jumped. I stuck my head around the corner. Sir?

Go to bed.

I scurried to my room and went to bed. Uncle Jack was a prince of a fellow not to letme down. But I never figured out how Atticus knew I was listening, and it was not untilmany years later that I realized he wanted me to hear every word he said.


Chapter 10

Atticus was feeble: he was nearly fifty. When Jem and I asked him why he was so old,he said he got started late, which we felt reflected upon his abilities and manliness. Hewas much older than the parents of our school contemporaries, and there was nothingJem or I could say about him when our classmates said, My father

Jem was football crazy. Atticus was never too tired to play keep-away, but when Jemwanted to tackle him Atticus would say, Im too old for that, son.

Our father didnt do anything. He worked in an office, not in a drugstore. Atticus did notdrive a dump-truck for the county, he was not the sheriff, he did not farm, work in agarage, or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of anyone.

Besides that, he wore glasses. He was nearly blind in his left eye, and said left eyeswere the tribal curse of the Finches. Whenever he wanted to see something well, heturned his head and looked from his right eye.

He did not do the things our schoolmates fathers did: he never went hunting, he didnot play poker or fish or drink or smoke. He sat in the livingroom and read.

With these attributes, however, he would not remain as inconspicuous as we wishedhim to: that year, the school buzzed with talk about him defending Tom Robinson, noneof which was complimentary. After my bout with Cecil Jacobs when I committed myselfto a policy of cowardice, word got around that Scout Finch wouldnt fight any more, herdaddy wouldnt let her. This was not entirely correct: I wouldnt fight publicly for Atticus,but the family was private ground. I would fight anyone from a third cousin upwardstooth and nail. Francis Hancock, for example, knew that.

When he gave us our air-rifles Atticus wouldnt teach us to shoot. Uncle Jackinstructed us in the rudiments thereof; he said Atticus wasnt interested in guns. Atticussaid to Jem one day, Id rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard, but I know youll goafter birds. Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit em, but remember its a sin tokill a mockingbird.

That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and Iasked Miss Maudie about it.

Your fathers right, she said. Mockingbirds dont do one thing but make music for usto enjoy. They dont eat up peoples gardens, dont nest in corncribs, they dont do onething but sing their hearts out for us. Thats why its a sin to kill a mockingbird.

Miss Maudie, this is an old neighborhood, aint it?

Been here longer than the town.

Nome, I mean the folks on our street are all old. Jem and mes the only childrenaround here. Mrs. Dubose is close on to a hundred and Miss Rachels old and so areyou and Atticus.

I dont call fifty very old, said Miss Maudie tartly. Not being wheeled around yet, amI? Neithers your father. But I must say Providence was kind enough to burn down thatold mausoleum of mine, Im too old to keep it upmaybe youre right, Jean Louise, thisis a settled neighborhood. Youve never been around young folks much, have you?

Yessum, at school.

I mean young grown-ups. Youre lucky, you know. You and Jem have the benefit ofyour fathers age. If your father was thirty youd find life quite different.

I sure would. Atticus cant do anything

Youd be surprised, said Miss Maudie. Theres life in him yet.

What can he do?

Well, he can make somebodys will so airtight cant anybody meddle with it.

Shoot

Well, did you know hes the best checker-player in this town? Why, down at theLanding when we were coming up, Atticus Finch could beat everybody on both sides ofthe river.

Good Lord, Miss Maudie, Jem and me beat him all the time.

Its about time you found out its because he lets you. Did you know he can play aJews Harp?

This modest accomplishment served to make me even more ashamed of him.

Well she said.

Well, what, Miss Maudie?

Well nothing. Nothingit seems with all that youd be proud of him. Cant everybodyplay a Jews Harp. Now keep out of the way of the carpenters. Youd better go home, Illbe in my azaleas and cant watch you. Plank might hit you.

I went to the back yard and found Jem plugging away at a tin can, which seemedstupid with all the bluejays around. I returned to the front yard and busied myself for twohours erecting a complicated breastworks at the side of the porch, consisting of a tire,an orange crate, the laundry hamper, the porch chairs, and a small U.S. flag Jem gaveme from a popcorn box.

When Atticus came home to dinner he found me crouched down aiming across thestreet. What are you shooting at?

Miss Maudies rear end.

Atticus turned and saw my generous target bending over her bushes. He pushed hishat to the back of his head and crossed the street. Maudie, he called, I thought Idbetter warn you. Youre in considerable peril.

Miss Maudie straightened up and looked toward me. She said, Atticus, you are adevil from hell.

When Atticus returned he told me to break camp. Dont you ever let me catch youpointing that gun at anybody again, he said.

I wished my father was a devil from hell. I sounded out Calpurnia on the subject. Mr.

Finch? Why, he can do lots of things.

Like what? I asked.

Calpurnia scratched her head. Well, I dont rightly know, she said.

Jem underlined it when he asked Atticus if he was going out for the Methodists andAtticus said hed break his neck if he did, he was just too old for that sort of thing. TheMethodists were trying to pay off their church mortgage, and had challenged theBaptists to a game of touch football. Everybody in towns father was playing, it seemed,except Atticus. Jem said he didnt even want to go, but he was unable to resist footballin any form, and he stood gloomily on the sidelines with Atticus and me watching CecilJacobss father make touchdowns for the Baptists.

One Saturday Jem and I decided to go exploring with our air-rifles to see if we couldfind a rabbit or a squirrel. We had gone about five hundred yards beyond the RadleyPlace when I noticed Jem squinting at something down the street. He had turned hishead to one side and was looking out of the corners of his eyes.

Whatcha looking at?

That old dog down yonder, he said.

Thats old Tim Johnson, aint it?

Yeah.

Tim Johnson was the property of Mr. Harry Johnson who drove the Mobile bus andlived on the southern edge of town. Tim was a liver-colored bird dog, the pet ofMaycomb.

Whats he doing?

I dont know, Scout. We better go home.

Aw Jem, its February.

I dont care, Im gonna tell Cal.

We raced home and ran to the kitchen.

Cal, said Jem, can you come down the sidewalk a minute?

What for, Jem? I cant come down the sidewalk every time you want me.

Theres somethin wrong with an old dog down yonder.

Calpurnia sighed. I cant wrap up any dogs foot now. Theres some gauze in thebathroom, go get it and do it yourself.

Jem shook his head. Hes sick, Cal. Somethings wrong with him.

Whats he doin, trying to catch his tail?

No, hes doin like this.

Jem gulped like a goldfish, hunched his shoulders and twitched his torso. Hes goinlike that, only not like he means to.

Are you telling me a story, Jem Finch? Calpurnias voice hardened.

No Cal, I swear Im not.

Was he runnin?

No, hes just moseyin along, so slow you cant hardly tell it. Hes comin this way.

Calpurnia rinsed her hands and followed Jem into the yard. I dont see any dog, shesaid.

She followed us beyond the Radley Place and looked where Jem pointed. TimJohnson was not much more than a speck in the distance, but he was closer to us. Hewalked erratically, as if his right legs were shorter than his left legs. He reminded me ofa car stuck in a sandbed.

Hes gone lopsided, said Jem.

Calpurnia stared, then grabbed us by the shoulders and ran us home. She shut thewood door behind us, went to the telephone and shouted, Gimme Mr. Finchs office!

Mr. Finch! she shouted. This is Cal. I swear to God theres a mad dog down thestreet a piecehes comin this way, yes sir, hesMr. Finch, I declare he isold TimJohnson, yes sir yessir yes

She hung up and shook her head when we tried to ask her what Atticus had said. Sherattled the telephone hook and said, Miss Eula Maynow maam, Im through talkin toMr. Finch, please dont connect me no morelisten, Miss Eula May, can you call MissRachel and Miss Stephanie Crawford and whoevers got a phone on this street and tellem a mad dogs comin? Please maam!

Calpurnia listened. I know its February, Miss Eula May, but I know a mad dog when Isee one. Please maam hurry!

Calpurnia asked Jem, Radleys got a phone?

Jem looked in the book and said no. They wont come out anyway, Cal.

I dont care, Im gonna tell em.

She ran to the front porch, Jem and I at her heels. You stay in that house! she yelled.

Calpurnias message had been received by the neighborhood. Every wood door withinour range of vision was closed tight. We saw no trace of Tim Johnson. We watchedCalpurnia running toward the Radley Place, holding her skirt and apron above herknees. She went up to the front steps and banged on the door. She got no answer, andshe shouted, Mr. Nathan, Mr. Arthur, mad dogs comin! Mad dogs comin!

Shes supposed to go around in back, I said.

Jem shook his head. Dont make any difference now, he said.

Calpurnia pounded on the door in vain. No one acknowledged her warning; no oneseemed to have heard it.

As Calpurnia sprinted to the back porch a black Ford swung into the driveway. Atticusand Mr. Heck Tate got out.

Mr. Heck Tate was the sheriff of Maycomb County. He was as tall as Atticus, butthinner. He was long-nosed, wore boots with shiny metal eye-holes, boot pants and alumber jacket. His belt had a row of bullets sticking in it. He carried a heavy rifle. Whenhe and Atticus reached the porch, Jem opened the door.

Stay inside, son, said Atticus. Where is he, Cal?

He oughta be here by now, said Calpurnia, pointing down the street.

Not runnin, is he? asked Mr. Tate.

Naw sir, hes in the twitchin stage, Mr. Heck.

Should we go after him, Heck? asked Atticus.

We better wait, Mr. Finch. They usually go in a straight line, but you never can tell. Hemight follow the curvehope he does or hell go straight in the Radley back yard. Letswait a minute.

Dont think hell get in the Radley yard, said Atticus. Fencell stop him. Hell probablyfollow the road

I thought mad dogs foamed at the mouth, galloped, leaped and lunged at throats, andI thought they did it in August. Had Tim Johnson behaved thus, I would have been lessfrightened.

Nothing is more deadly than a deserted, waiting street. The trees were still, themockingbirds were silent, the carpenters at Miss Maudies house had vanished. I heardMr. Tate sniff, then blow his nose. I saw him shift his gun to the crook of his arm. I sawMiss Stephanie Crawfords face framed in the glass window of her front door. MissMaudie appeared and stood beside her. Atticus put his foot on the rung of a chair andrubbed his hand slowly down the side of his thigh.

There he is, he said softly.

Tim Johnson came into sight, walking dazedly in the inner rim of the curve parallel tothe Radley house.

Look at him, whispered Jem. Mr. Heck said they walked in a straight line. He canteven stay in the road.

He looks more sick than anything, I said.

Let anything get in front of him and hell come straight at it.

Mr. Tate put his hand to his forehead and leaned forward. Hes got it all right, Mr.

Finch.

Tim Johnson was advancing at a snails pace, but he was not playing or sniffing atfoliage: he seemed dedicated to one course and motivated by an invisible force that wasinching him toward us. We could see him shiver like a horse shedding flies; his jawopened and shut; he was alist, but he was being pulled gradually toward us.

Hes lookin for a place to die, said Jem.

Mr. Tate turned around. Hes far from dead, Jem, he hasnt got started yet.

Tim Johnson reached the side street that ran in front of the Radley Place, and whatremained of his poor mind made him pause and seem to consider which road he wouldtake. He made a few hesitant steps and stopped in front of the Radley gate; then hetried to turn around, but was having difficulty.

Atticus said, Hes within range, Heck. You better get him before he goes down theside streetLord knows whos around the corner. Go inside, Cal.

Calpurnia opened the screen door, latched it behind her, then unlatched it and heldonto the hook. She tried to block Jem and me with her body, but we looked out frombeneath her arms.

Take him, Mr. Finch. Mr. Tate handed the rifle to Atticus; Jem and I nearly fainted.

Dont waste time, Heck, said Atticus. Go on.

Mr. Finch, this is a one-shot job.

Atticus shook his head vehemently: Dont just stand there, Heck! He wont wait all dayfor you

For Gods sake, Mr. Finch, look where he is! Miss and youll go straight into theRadley house! I cant shoot that well and you know it!

I havent shot a gun in thirty years

Mr. Tate almost threw the rifle at Atticus. Id feel mighty comfortable if you did now,

he said.

In a fog, Jem and I watched our father take the gun and walk out into the middle of thestreet. He walked quickly, but I thought he moved like an underwater swimmer: time hadslowed to a nauseating crawl.

When Atticus raised his glasses Calpurnia murmured, Sweet Jesus help him, andput her hands to her cheeks.

Atticus pushed his glasses to his forehead; they slipped down, and he dropped themin the street. In the silence, I heard them crack. Atticus rubbed his eyes and chin; wesaw him blink hard.

In front of the Radley gate, Tim Johnson had made up what was left of his mind. Hehad finally turned himself around, to pursue his original course up our street. He madetwo steps forward, then stopped and raised his head. We saw his body go rigid.

With movements so swift they seemed simultaneous, Atticuss hand yanked a ball-tipped lever as he brought the gun to his shoulder.

The rifle cracked. Tim Johnson leaped, flopped over and crumpled on the sidewalk ina brown-and-white heap. He didnt know what hit him.

Mr. Tate jumped off the porch and ran to the Radley Place. He stopped in front of thedog, squatted, turned around and tapped his finger on his forehead above his left eye.

You were a little to the right, Mr. Finch, he called.

Always was, answered Atticus. If I had my druthers Id take a shotgun.

He stooped and picked up his glasses, ground the broken lenses to powder under hisheel, and went to Mr. Tate and stood looking down at Tim Johnson.

Doors opened one by one, and the neighborhood slowly came alive. Miss Maudiewalked down the steps with Miss Stephanie Crawford.

Jem was paralyzed. I pinched him to get him moving, but when Atticus saw us cominghe called, Stay where you are.

When Mr. Tate and Atticus returned to the yard, Mr. Tate was smiling. Ill have Zeebocollect him, he said. You havent forgot much, Mr. Finch. They say it never leavesyou.

Atticus was silent.

Atticus? said Jem.

Yes?

Nothin.

I saw that, One-Shot Finch!

Atticus wheeled around and faced Miss Maudie. They looked at one another withoutsaying anything, and Atticus got into the sheriffs car. Come here, he said to Jem.

Dont you go near that dog, you understand? Dont go near him, hes just as dangerousdead as alive.

Yes sir, said Jem. Atticus

What, son?

Nothing.

Whats the matter with you, boy, cant you talk? said Mr. Tate, grinning at Jem.

Didnt you know your daddys

Hush, Heck, said Atticus, lets go back to town.

When they drove away, Jem and I went to Miss Stephanies front steps. We satwaiting for Zeebo to arrive in the garbage truck.

Jem sat in numb confusion, and Miss Stephanie said, Uh, uh, uh, whoda thought of amad dog in February? Maybe he wadnt mad, maybe he was just crazy. Id hate to seeHarry Johnsons face when he gets in from the Mobile run and finds Atticus Finchs shothis dog. Bet he was just full of fleas from somewhere

Miss Maudie said Miss Stephanied be singing a different tune if Tim Johnson was stillcoming up the street, that theyd find out soon enough, theyd send his head toMontgomery.

Jem became vaguely articulate: d you see him, Scout? d you see him just standinthere? n all of a sudden he just relaxed all over, an it looked like that gun was a partof him an he did it so quick, like I hafta aim for ten minutes fore I can hitsomethin

Miss Maudie grinned wickedly. Well now, Miss Jean Louise, she said, still think yourfather cant do anything? Still ashamed of him?

Nome, I said meekly.

Forgot to tell you the other day that besides playing the Jews Harp, Atticus Finch wasthe deadest shot in Maycomb County in his time.

Dead shot echoed Jem.

Thats what I said, Jem Finch. Guess youll change your tune now. The very idea,didnt you know his nickname was Ol One-Shot when he was a boy? Why, down at theLanding when he was coming up, if he shot fifteen times and hit fourteen doves hedcomplain about wasting ammunition.

He never said anything about that, Jem muttered.

Never said anything about it, did he?

No maam.

Wonder why he never goes huntin now, I said.

Maybe I can tell you, said Miss Maudie. If your fathers anything, hes civilized in hisheart. Marksmanships a gift of God, a talentoh, you have to practice to make itperfect, but shootins different from playing the piano or the like. I think maybe he put hisgun down when he realized that God had given him an unfair advantage over mostliving things. I guess he decided he wouldnt shoot till he had to, and he had to today.

Looks like hed be proud of it, I said.

People in their right minds never take pride in their talents, said Miss Maudie.

We saw Zeebo drive up. He took a pitchfork from the back of the garbage truck andgingerly lifted Tim Johnson. He pitched the dog onto the truck, then poured somethingfrom a gallon jug on and around the spot where Tim fell. Dont yawl come over here fora while, he called.

When we went home I told Jem wed really have something to talk about at school onMonday. Jem turned on me.

Dont say anything about it, Scout, he said.

What? I certainly am. Aint everybodys daddy the deadest shot in Maycomb County.

Jem said, I reckon if hed wanted us to know it, heda told us. If he was proud of it,heda told us.

Maybe it just slipped his mind, I said.

Naw, Scout, its something you wouldnt understand. Atticus is real old, but I wouldntcare if he couldnt do anythingI wouldnt care if he couldnt do a blessed thing.

Jem picked up a rock and threw it jubilantly at the carhouse. Running after it, he calledback: Atticus is a gentleman, just like me!

Chapter 11

When we were small, Jem and I confined our activities to the southern neighborhood,but when I was well into the second grade at school and tormenting Boo Radley becamepasse, the business section of Maycomb drew us frequently up the street past the realproperty of Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose. It was impossible to go to town withoutpassing her house unless we wished to walk a mile out of the way. Previous minorencounters with her left me with no desire for more, but Jem said I had to grow up sometime.

Mrs. Dubose lived alone except for a Negro girl in constant attendance, two doors upthe street from us in a house with steep front steps and a dog-trot hall. She was veryold; she spent most of each day in bed and the rest of it in a wheelchair. It was rumoredthat she kept a CSA pistol concealed among her numerous shawls and wraps.

Jem and I hated her. If she was on the porch when we passed, we would be raked byher wrathful gaze, subjected to ruthless interrogation regarding our behavior, and givena melancholy prediction on what we would amount to when we grew up, which wasalways nothing. We had long ago given up the idea of walking past her house on theopposite side of the street; that only made her raise her voice and let the wholeneighborhood in on it.

We could do nothing to please her. If I said as sunnily as I could, Hey, Mrs. Dubose,

I would receive for an answer, Dont you say hey to me, you ugly girl! You say goodafternoon, Mrs. Dubose!

She was vicious. Once she heard Jem refer to our father as Atticus and her reactionwas apoplectic. Besides being the sassiest, most disrespectful mutts who ever passedher way, we were told that it was quite a pity our father had not remarried after ourmothers death. A lovelier lady than our mother never lived, she said, and it washeartbreaking the way Atticus Finch let her children run wild. I did not remember ourmother, but Jem didhe would tell me about her sometimesand he went livid whenMrs. Dubose shot us this message.

Jem, having survived Boo Radley, a mad dog and other terrors, had concluded that itwas cowardly to stop at Miss Rachels front steps and wait, and had decreed that wemust run as far as the post office corner each evening to meet Atticus coming fromwork. Countless evenings Atticus would find Jem furious at something Mrs. Dubose hadsaid when we went by.

Easy does it, son, Atticus would say. Shes an old lady and shes ill. You just holdyour head high and be a gentleman. Whatever she says to you, its your job not to lether make you mad. Jem would say she must not be very sick, she hollered so. Whenthe three of us came to her house, Atticus would sweep off his hat, wave gallantly to herand say, Good evening, Mrs. Dubose! You look like a picture this evening.

I never heard Atticus say like a picture of what. He would tell her the courthouse news,and would say he hoped with all his heart shed have a good day tomorrow. He wouldreturn his hat to his head, swing me to his shoulders in her very presence, and we wouldgo home in the twilight. It was times like these when I thought my father, who hatedguns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever lived.

The day after Jems twelfth birthday his money was burning up his pockets, so weheaded for town in the early afternoon. Jem thought he had enough to buy a miniaturesteam engine for himself and a twirling baton for me.

I had long had my eye on that baton: it was at V. J. Elmores, it was bedecked withsequins and tinsel, it cost seventeen cents. It was then my burning ambition to grow upand twirl with the Maycomb County High School band. Having developed my talent towhere I could throw up a stick and almost catch it coming down, I had caused Calpurniato deny me entrance to the house every time she saw me with a stick in my hand. I feltthat I could overcome this defect with a real baton, and I thought it generous of Jem tobuy one for me.

Mrs. Dubose was stationed on her porch when we went by.

Where are you two going at this time of day? she shouted. Playing hooky, Isuppose. Ill just call up the principal and tell him! She put her hands on the wheels ofher chair and executed a perfect right face.

Aw, its Saturday, Mrs. Dubose, said Jem.

Makes no difference if its Saturday, she said obscurely. I wonder if your fatherknows where you are?

Mrs. Dubose, weve been goin to town by ourselves since we were this high. Jemplaced his hand palm down about two feet above the sidewalk.

Dont you lie to me! she yelled. Jeremy Finch, Maudie Atkinson told me you brokedown her scuppernong arbor this morning. Shes going to tell your father and then youllwish you never saw the light of day! If you arent sent to the reform school before nextweek, my names not Dubose!

Jem, who hadnt been near Miss Maudies scuppernong arbor since last summer, andwho knew Miss Maudie wouldnt tell Atticus if he had, issued a general denial.

Dont you contradict me! Mrs. Dubose bawled. And you she pointed an arthriticfinger at mewhat are you doing in those overalls? You should be in a dress andcamisole, young lady! Youll grow up waiting on tables if somebody doesnt change yourwaysa Finch waiting on tables at the O.K. Cafhah!

I was terrified. The O.K. Caf was a dim organization on the north side of the square. Igrabbed Jems hand but he shook me loose.

Come on, Scout, he whispered. Dont pay any attention to her, just hold your headhigh and be a gentleman.

But Mrs. Dubose held us: Not only a Finch waiting on tables but one in thecourthouse lawing for niggers!

Jem stiffened. Mrs. Duboses shot had gone home and she knew it:

Yes indeed, what has this world come to when a Finch goes against his raising? Illtell you! She put her hand to her mouth. When she drew it away, it trailed a long silverthread of saliva. Your fathers no better than the niggers and trash he works for!

Jem was scarlet. I pulled at his sleeve, and we were followed up the sidewalk by aphilippic on our familys moral degeneration, the major premise of which was that halfthe Finches were in the asylum anyway, but if our mother were living we would not havecome to such a state.

I wasnt sure what Jem resented most, but I took umbrage at Mrs. Dubosesassessment of the familys mental hygiene. I had become almost accustomed to hearinginsults aimed at Atticus. But this was the first one coming from an adult. Except for herremarks about Atticus, Mrs. Duboses attack was only routine. There was a hint ofsummer in the airin the shadows it was cool, but the sun was warm, which meantgood times coming: no school and Dill.

Jem bought his steam engine and we went by Elmores for my baton. Jem took nopleasure in his acquisition; he jammed it in his pocket and walked silently beside metoward home. On the way home I nearly hit Mr. Link Deas, who said, Look out now,Scout! when I missed a toss, and when we approached Mrs. Duboses house my batonwas grimy from having picked it up out of the dirt so many times.

She was not on the porch.

In later years, I sometimes wondered exactly what made Jem do it, what made himbreak the bonds of You just be a gentleman, son, and the phase of self-consciousrectitude he had recently entered. Jem had probably stood as much guff about Atticuslawing for niggers as had I, and I took it for granted that he kept his temperhe had anaturally tranquil disposition and a slow fuse. At the time, however, I thought the onlyexplanation for what he did was that for a few minutes he simply went mad.

What Jem did was something Id do as a matter of course had I not been underAtticuss interdict, which I assumed included not fighting horrible old ladies. We had justcome to her gate when Jem snatched my baton and ran flailing wildly up the steps intoMrs. Duboses front yard, forgetting everything Atticus had said, forgetting that shepacked a pistol under her shawls, forgetting that if Mrs. Dubose missed, her girl Jessieprobably wouldnt.

He did not begin to calm down until he had cut the tops off every camellia bush Mrs.

Dubose owned, until the ground was littered with green buds and leaves. He bent mybaton against his knee, snapped it in two and threw it down.

By that time I was shrieking. Jem yanked my hair, said he didnt care, hed do it againif he got a chance, and if I didnt shut up hed pull every hair out of my head. I didnt shutup and he kicked me. I lost my balance and fell on my face. Jem picked me up roughlybut looked like he was sorry. There was nothing to say.

We did not choose to meet Atticus coming home that evening. We skulked around thekitchen until Calpurnia threw us out. By some voo-doo system Calpurnia seemed toknow all about it. She was a less than satisfactory source of palliation, but she did giveJem a hot biscuit-and-butter which he tore in half and shared with me. It tasted likecotton.

We went to the livingroom. I picked up a football magazine, found a picture of DixieHowell, showed it to Jem and said, This looks like you. That was the nicest thing Icould think to say to him, but it was no help. He sat by the windows, hunched down in arocking chair, scowling, waiting. Daylight faded.

Two geological ages later, we heard the soles of Atticuss shoes scrape the frontsteps. The screen door slammed, there was a pauseAtticus was at the hat rack in thehalland we heard him call, Jem! His voice was like the winter wind.

Atticus switched on the ceiling light in the livingroom and found us there, frozen still.

He carried my baton in one hand; its filthy yellow tassel trailed on the rug. He held outhis other hand; it contained fat camellia buds.

Jem, he said, are you responsible for this?

Yes sir.

Whyd you do it?

Jem said softly, She said you lawed for niggers and trash.

You did this because she said that?

Jems lips moved, but his, Yes sir, was inaudible.

Son, I have no doubt that youve been annoyed by your contemporaries about melawing for niggers, as you say, but to do something like this to a sick old lady isinexcusable. I strongly advise you to go down and have a talk with Mrs. Dubose, saidAtticus. Come straight home afterward.

Jem did not move.

Go on, I said.

I followed Jem out of the livingroom. Come back here, Atticus said to me. I cameback.

Atticus picked up the Mobile Press and sat down in the rocking chair Jem hadvacated. For the life of me, I did not understand how he could sit there in cold blood andread a newspaper when his only son stood an excellent chance of being murdered witha Confederate Army relic. Of course Jem antagonized me sometimes until I could killhim, but when it came down to it he was all I had. Atticus did not seem to realize this, orif he did he didnt care.

I hated him for that, but when you are in trouble you become easily tired: soon I washiding in his lap and his arms were around me.

Youre mighty big to be rocked, he said.

You dont care what happens to him, I said. You just send him on to get shot atwhen all he was doin was standin up for you.

Atticus pushed my head under his chin. Its not time to worry yet, he said. I neverthought Jemd be the one to lose his head over thisthought Id have more trouble withyou.

I said I didnt see why we had to keep our heads anyway, that nobody I knew at schoolhad to keep his head about anything.

Scout, said Atticus, when summer comes youll have to keep your head about farworse things its not fair for you and Jem, I know that, but sometimes we have tomake the best of things, and the way we conduct ourselves when the chips are downwell, all I can say is, when you and Jem are grown, maybe youll look back on this withsome compassion and some feeling that I didnt let you down. This case, TomRobinsons case, is something that goes to the essence of a mans conscienceScout,I couldnt go to church and worship God if I didnt try to help that man.

Atticus, you must be wrong

Hows that?

Well, most folks seem to think theyre right and youre wrong

Theyre certainly entitled to think that, and theyre entitled to full respect for theiropinions, said Atticus, but before I can live with other folks Ive got to live with myself.

The one thing that doesnt abide by majority rule is a persons conscience.

When Jem returned, he found me still in Atticuss lap, Well, son? said Atticus. He setme on my feet, and I made a secret reconnaissance of Jem. He seemed to be all in onepiece, but he had a queer look on his face. Perhaps she had given him a dose ofcalomel.

I cleaned it up for her and said I was sorry, but I aint, and that Id work on em everSaturday and try to make em grow back out.

There was no point in saying you were sorry if you arent, said Atticus. Jem, shesold and ill. You cant hold her responsible for what she says and does. Of course, Idrather shed have said it to me than to either of you, but we cant always have ourdruthers.

Jem seemed fascinated by a rose in the carpet. Atticus, he said, she wants me toread to her.

Read to her?

Yes sir. She wants me to come every afternoon after school and Saturdays and readto her out loud for two hours. Atticus, do I have to?

Certainly.

But she wants me to do it for a month.

Then youll do it for a month.

Jem planted his big toe delicately in the center of the rose and pressed it in. Finally hesaid, Atticus, its all right on the sidewalk but inside itsits all dark and creepy. Theresshadows and things on the ceiling

Atticus smiled grimly. That should appeal to your imagination. Just pretend youreinside the Radley house.

The following Monday afternoon Jem and I climbed the steep front steps to Mrs.

Duboses house and padded down the open hallway. Jem, armed with Ivanhoe and fullof superior knowledge, knocked at the second door on the left.

Mrs. Dubose? he called.

Jessie opened the wood door and unlatched the screen door.

Is that you, Jem Finch? she said. You got your sister with you. I dont know

Let em both in, Jessie, said Mrs. Dubose. Jessie admitted us and went off to thekitchen.

An oppressive odor met us when we crossed the threshold, an odor I had met manytimes in rain-rotted gray houses where there are coal-oil lamps, water dippers, andunbleached domestic sheets. It always made me afraid, expectant, watchful.

In the corner of the room was a brass bed, and in the bed was Mrs. Dubose. Iwondered if Jems activities had put her there, and for a moment I felt sorry for her. Shewas lying under a pile of quilts and looked almost friendly.

There was a marble-topped washstand by her bed; on it were a glass with a teaspoonin it, a red ear syringe, a box of absorbent cotton, and a steel alarm clock standing onthree tiny legs.

So you brought that dirty little sister of yours, did you? was her greeting.

Jem said quietly, My sister aint dirty and I aint scared of you, although I noticed hisknees shaking.

I was expecting a tirade, but all she said was, You may commence reading, Jeremy.

Jem sat down in a cane-bottom chair and opened Ivanhoe. I pulled up another oneand sat beside him.

Come closer, said Mrs. Dubose. Come to the side of the bed.

We moved our chairs forward. This was the nearest I had ever been to her, and thething I wanted most to do was move my chair back again.

She was horrible. Her face was the color of a dirty pillowcase, and the corners of hermouth glistened with wet, which inched like a glacier down the deep grooves enclosingher chin. Old-age liver spots dotted her cheeks, and her pale eyes had black pinpointpupils. Her hands were knobby, and the cuticles were grown up over her fingernails. Herbottom plate was not in, and her upper lip protruded; from time to time she would drawher nether lip to her upper plate and carry her chin with it. This made the wet movefaster.

I didnt look any more than I had to. Jem reopened Ivanhoe and began reading. I triedto keep up with him, but he read too fast. When Jem came to a word he didnt know, heskipped it, but Mrs. Dubose would catch him and make him spell it out. Jem read forperhaps twenty minutes, during which time I looked at the soot-stained mantelpiece, outthe window, anywhere to keep from looking at her. As he read along, I noticed that Mrs.

Duboses corrections grew fewer and farther between, that Jem had even left onesentence dangling in mid-air. She was not listening.

I looked toward the bed.

Something had happened to her. She lay on her back, with the quilts up to her chin.

Only her head and shoulders were visible. Her head moved slowly from side to side.

From time to time she would open her mouth wide, and I could see her tongue undulatefaintly. Cords of saliva would collect on her lips; she would draw them in, then open hermouth again. Her mouth seemed to have a private existence of its own. It workedseparate and apart from the rest of her, out and in, like a clam hole at low tide.

Occasionally it would say, Pt, like some viscous substance coming to a boil.

I pulled Jems sleeve.

He looked at me, then at the bed. Her head made its regular sweep toward us, andJem said, Mrs. Dubose, are you all right? She did not hear him.

The alarm clock went off and scared us stiff. A minute later, nerves still tingling, Jemand I were on the sidewalk headed for home. We did not run away, Jessie sent us:

before the clock wound down she was in the room pushing Jem and me out of it.

Shoo, she said, you all go home.

Jem hesitated at the door.

Its time for her medicine, Jessie said. As the door swung shut behind us I sawJessie walking quickly toward Mrs. Duboses bed.

It was only three forty-five when we got home, so Jem and I drop-kicked in the backyard until it was time to meet Atticus. Atticus had two yellow pencils for me and afootball magazine for Jem, which I suppose was a silent reward for our first dayssession with Mrs. Dubose. Jem told him what happened.

Did she frighten you? asked Atticus.

No sir, said Jem, but shes so nasty. She has fits or somethin. She spits a lot.

She cant help that. When people are sick they dont look nice sometimes.

She scared me, I said.

Atticus looked at me over his glasses. You dont have to go with Jem, you know.

The next afternoon at Mrs. Duboses was the same as the first, and so was the next,until gradually a pattern emerged: everything would begin normallythat is, Mrs.

Dubose would hound Jem for a while on her favorite subjects, her camellias and ourfathers nigger-loving propensities; she would grow increasingly silent, then go awayfrom us. The alarm clock would ring, Jessie would shoo us out, and the rest of the daywas ours.

Atticus, I said one evening, what exactly is a nigger-lover?

Atticuss face was grave. Has somebody been calling you that?

No sir, Mrs. Dubose calls you that. She warms up every afternoon calling you that.

Francis called me that last Christmas, thats where I first heard it.

Is that the reason you jumped on him? asked Atticus.

Yes sir

Then why are you asking me what it means?

I tried to explain to Atticus that it wasnt so much what Francis said that had infuriatedme as the way he had said it. It was like hed said snot-nose or somethin.

Scout, said Atticus, nigger-lover is just one of those terms that dont meananythinglike snot-nose. Its hard to explainignorant, trashy people use it when theythink somebodys favoring Negroes over and above themselves. Its slipped into usagewith some people like ourselves, when they want a common, ugly term to labelsomebody.

You arent really a nigger-lover, then, are you?

I certainly am. I do my best to love everybody Im hard put, sometimesbaby, itsnever an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name. It just shows you howpoor that person is, it doesnt hurt you. So dont let Mrs. Dubose get you down. She hasenough troubles of her own.

One afternoon a month later Jem was ploughing his way through Sir Walter Scout, asJem called him, and Mrs. Dubose was correcting him at every turn, when there was aknock on the door. Come in! she screamed.

Atticus came in. He went to the bed and took Mrs. Duboses hand. I was coming fromthe office and didnt see the children, he said. I thought they might still be here.

Mrs. Dubose smiled at him. For the life of me I could not figure out how she couldbring herself to speak to him when she seemed to hate him so. Do you know what timeit is, Atticus? she said. Exactly fourteen minutes past five. The alarm clocks set forfive-thirty. I want you to know that.

It suddenly came to me that each day we had been staying a little longer at Mrs.

Duboses, that the alarm clock went off a few minutes later every day, and that she waswell into one of her fits by the time it sounded. Today she had antagonized Jem fornearly two hours with no intention of having a fit, and I felt hopelessly trapped. Thealarm clock was the signal for our release; if one day it did not ring, what would we do?

I have a feeling that Jems reading days are numbered, said Atticus.

Only a week longer, I think, she said, just to make sure

Jem rose. But

Atticus put out his hand and Jem was silent. On the way home, Jem said he had to doit just for a month and the month was up and it wasnt fair.

Just one more week, son, said Atticus.

No, said Jem. Yes, said Atticus.

The following week found us back at Mrs. Duboses. The alarm clock had ceasedsounding, but Mrs. Dubose would release us with, Thatll do, so late in the afternoonAtticus would be home reading the paper when we returned. Although her fits hadpassed off, she was in every other way her old self: when Sir Walter Scott becameinvolved in lengthy descriptions of moats and castles, Mrs. Dubose would become boredand pick on us:

Jeremy Finch, I told you youd live to regret tearing up my camellias. You regret itnow, dont you?

Jem would say he certainly did.

Thought you could kill my Snow-on-the-Mountain, did you? Well, Jessie says thetops growing back out. Next time youll know how to do it right, wont you? Youll pull itup by the roots, wont you?

Jem would say he certainly would.

Dont you mutter at me, boy! You hold up your head and say yes maam. Dont guessyou feel like holding it up, though, with your father what he is.

Jems chin would come up, and he would gaze at Mrs. Dubose with a face devoid ofresentment. Through the weeks he had cultivated an expression of polite and detachedinterest, which he would present to her in answer to her most blood-curdling inventions.

At last the day came. When Mrs. Dubose said, Thatll do, one afternoon, she added,And thats all. Good-day to you.

It was over. We bounded down the sidewalk on a spree of sheer relief, leaping andhowling.

That spring was a good one: the days grew longer and gave us more playing time.

Jems mind was occupied mostly with the vital statistics of every college football playerin the nation. Every night Atticus would read us the sports pages of the newspapers.

Alabama might go to the Rose Bowl again this year, judging from its prospects, not oneof whose names we could pronounce. Atticus was in the middle of Windy Seatonscolumn one evening when the telephone rang.

He answered it, then went to the hat rack in the hall. Im going down to Mrs. Dubosesfor a while, he said. I wont be long.

But Atticus stayed away until long past my bedtime. When he returned he wascarrying a candy box. Atticus sat down in the livingroom and put the box on the floorbeside his chair.

Whatd she want? asked Jem.

We had not seen Mrs. Dubose for over a month. She was never on the porch anymore when we passed.

Shes dead, son, said Atticus. She died a few minutes ago.

Oh, said Jem. Well.

Well is right, said Atticus. Shes not suffering any more. She was sick for a longtime. Son, didnt you know what her fits were?

Jem shook his head.

Mrs. Dubose was a morphine addict, said Atticus. She took it as a pain-killer foryears. The doctor put her on it. Shed have spent the rest of her life on it and diedwithout so much agony, but she was too contrary

Sir? said Jem.

Atticus said, Just before your escapade she called me to make her will. Dr. Reynoldstold her she had only a few months left. Her business affairs were in perfect order butshe said, Theres still one thing out of order.

What was that? Jem was perplexed.

She said she was going to leave this world beholden to nothing and nobody. Jem,when youre sick as she was, its all right to take anything to make it easier, but it wasntall right for her. She said she meant to break herself of it before she died, and thatswhat she did.

Jem said, You mean thats what her fits were?

Yes, thats what they were. Most of the time you were reading to her I doubt if sheheard a word you said. Her whole mind and body were concentrated on that alarmclock. If you hadnt fallen into her hands, Id have made you go read to her anyway. Itmay have been some distraction. There was another reason

Did she die free? asked Jem.

As the mountain air, said Atticus. She was conscious to the last, almost.

Conscious, he smiled, and cantankerous. She still disapproved heartily of my doings,and said Id probably spend the rest of my life bailing you out of jail. She had Jessie fixyou this box

Atticus reached down and picked up the candy box. He handed it to Jem.

Jem opened the box. Inside, surrounded by wads of damp cotton, was a white, waxy,perfect camellia. It was a Snow-on-the-Mountain.

Jems eyes nearly popped out of his head. Old hell-devil, old hell-devil! he screamed,flinging it down. Why cant she leave me alone?

In a flash Atticus was up and standing over him. Jem buried his face in Atticuss shirtfront. Sh-h, he said. I think that was her way of telling youeverythings all right now,Jem, everythings all right. You know, she was a great lady.

A lady? Jem raised his head. His face was scarlet. After all those things she saidabout you, a lady?

She was. She had her own views about things, a lot different from mine, maybeson, I told you that if you hadnt lost your head Id have made you go read to her. Iwanted you to see something about herI wanted you to see what real courage is,instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. Its when youknow youre licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through nomatter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do. Mrs. Dubose won, all ninety-eightpounds of her. According to her views, she died beholden to nothing and nobody. Shewas the bravest person I ever knew.

Jem picked up the candy box and threw it in the fire. He picked up the camellia, andwhen I went off to bed I saw him fingering the wide petals. Atticus was reading thepaper.


Chapter 12

Jem was twelve. He was difficult to live with, inconsistent, moody. His appetite wasappalling, and he told me so many times to stop pestering him I consulted Atticus:

Reckon hes got a tapeworm? Atticus said no, Jem was growing. I must be patient withhim and disturb him as little as possible.

This change in Jem had come about in a matter of weeks. Mrs. Dubose was not coldin her graveJem had seemed grateful enough for my company when he went to readto her. Overnight, it seemed, Jem had acquired an alien set of values and was trying toimpose them on me: several times he went so far as to tell me what to do. After onealtercation when Jem hollered, Its time you started bein a girl and acting right! I burstinto tears and fled to Calpurnia.

Dont you fret too much over Mister Jem she began.

Mister Jem?

Yeah, hes just about Mister Jem now.

He aint that old, I said. All he needs is somebody to beat him up, and I aint bigenough.

Baby, said Calpurnia, I just cant help it if Mister Jems growin up. Hes gonna wantto be off to himself a lot now, doin whatever boys do, so you just come right on in thekitchen when you feel lonesome. Well find lots of things to do in here.

The beginning of that summer boded well: Jem could do as he pleased; Calpurniawould do until Dill came. She seemed glad to see me when I appeared in the kitchen,and by watching her I began to think there was some skill involved in being a girl.

But summer came and Dill was not there. I received a letter and a snapshot from him.

The letter said he had a new father whose picture was enclosed, and he would have tostay in Meridian because they planned to build a fishing boat. His father was a lawyerlike Atticus, only much younger. Dills new father had a pleasant face, which made meglad Dill had captured him, but I was crushed. Dill concluded by saying he would loveme forever and not to worry, he would come get me and marry me as soon as he gotenough money together, so please write.

The fact that I had a permanent fianc was little compensation for his absence: I hadnever thought about it, but summer was Dill by the fishpool smoking string, Dills eyesalive with complicated plans to make Boo Radley emerge; summer was the swiftnesswith which Dill would reach up and kiss me when Jem was not looking, the longings wesometimes felt each other feel. With him, life was routine; without him, life wasunbearable. I stayed miserable for two days.

As if that were not enough, the state legislature was called into emergency sessionand Atticus left us for two weeks. The Governor was eager to scrape a few barnacles offthe ship of state; there were sit-down strikes in Birmingham; bread lines in the citiesgrew longer, people in the country grew poorer. But these were events remote from theworld of Jem and me.

We were surprised one morning to see a cartoon in the Montgomery Advertiser abovethe caption, Maycombs Finch. It showed Atticus barefooted and in short pants,chained to a desk: he was diligently writing on a slate while some frivolous-looking girlsyelled, Yoo-hoo! at him.

Thats a compliment, explained Jem. He spends his time doin things that wouldntget done if nobody did em.

Huh?

In addition to Jems newly developed characteristics, he had acquired a maddening airof wisdom.

Oh, Scout, its like reorganizing the tax systems of the counties and things. That kindof things pretty dry to most men.

How do you know?

Oh, go on and leave me alone. Im readin the paper.

Jem got his wish. I departed for the kitchen.

While she was shelling peas, Calpurnia suddenly said, What am I gonna do aboutyou alls church this Sunday?

Nothing, I reckon. Atticus left us collection.

Calpurnias eyes narrowed and I could tell what was going through her mind. Cal, Isaid, you know well behave. We havent done anything in church in years.

Calpurnia evidently remembered a rainy Sunday when we were both fatherless andteacherless. Left to its own devices, the class tied Eunice Ann Simpson to a chair andplaced her in the furnace room. We forgot her, trooped upstairs to church, and werelistening quietly to the sermon when a dreadful banging issued from the radiator pipes,persisting until someone investigated and brought forth Eunice Ann saying she didntwant to play Shadrach any moreJem Finch said she wouldnt get burnt if she hadenough faith, but it was hot down there.

Besides, Cal, this isnt the first time Atticus has left us, I protested.

Yeah, but he makes certain your teachers gonna be there. I didnt hear him say thistimereckon he forgot it. Calpurnia scratched her head. Suddenly she smiled. Howdyou and Mister Jem like to come to church with me tomorrow?

Really?

How bout it? grinned Calpurnia.

If Calpurnia had ever bathed me roughly before, it was nothing compared to hersupervision of that Saturday nights routine. She made me soap all over twice, drewfresh water in the tub for each rinse; she stuck my head in the basin and washed it withOctagon soap and castile. She had trusted Jem for years, but that night she invaded hisprivacy and provoked an outburst: Cant anybody take a bath in this house without thewhole family lookin?

Next morning she began earlier than usual, to go over our clothes. When Calpurniastayed overnight with us she slept on a folding cot in the kitchen; that morning it wascovered with our Sunday habiliments. She had put so much starch in my dress it cameup like a tent when I sat down. She made me wear a petticoat and she wrapped a pinksash tightly around my waist. She went over my patent-leather shoes with a cold biscuituntil she saw her face in them.

Its like we were goin to Mardi Gras, said Jem. Whats all this for, Cal?

I dont want anybody sayin I dont look after my children, she muttered. Mister Jem,you absolutely cant wear that tie with that suit. Its green.

Smatter with that?

Suits blue. Cant you tell?

Hee hee, I howled, Jems color blind.

His face flushed angrily, but Calpurnia said, Now you all quit that. Youre gonna go toFirst Purchase with smiles on your faces.

First Purchase African M.E. Church was in the Quarters outside the southern townlimits, across the old sawmill tracks. It was an ancient paint-peeled frame building, theonly church in Maycomb with a steeple and bell, called First Purchase because it waspaid for from the first earnings of freed slaves. Negroes worshiped in it on Sundays andwhite men gambled in it on weekdays.

The churchyard was brick-hard clay, as was the cemetery beside it. If someone diedduring a dry spell, the body was covered with chunks of ice until rain softened the earth.

A few graves in the cemetery were marked with crumbling tombstones; newer oneswere outlined with brightly colored glass and broken Coca-Cola bottles. Lightning rodsguarding some graves denoted dead who rested uneasily; stumps of burned-outcandles stood at the heads of infant graves. It was a happy cemetery.

The warm bittersweet smell of clean Negro welcomed us as we entered thechurchyardHearts of Love hairdressing mingled with asafoetida, snuff, HoytsCologne, Browns Mule, peppermint, and lilac talcum.

When they saw Jem and me with Calpurnia, the men stepped back and took off theirhats; the women crossed their arms at their waists, weekday gestures of respectfulattention. They parted and made a small pathway to the church door for us. Calpurniawalked between Jem and me, responding to the greetings of her brightly clad neighbors.

What you up to, Miss Cal? said a voice behind us.

Calpurnias hands went to our shoulders and we stopped and looked around: standingin the path behind us was a tall Negro woman. Her weight was on one leg; she restedher left elbow in the curve of her hip, pointing at us with upturned palm. She was bullet-headed with strange almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and an Indian-bow mouth. Sheseemed seven feet high.

I felt Calpurnias hand dig into my shoulder. What you want, Lula? she asked, intones I had never heard her use. She spoke quietly, contemptuously.

I wants to know why you bringin white chillun to nigger church.

Theys my compny, said Calpurnia. Again I thought her voice strange: she wastalking like the rest of them.

Yeah, an I reckon yous compny at the Finch house durin the week.

A murmur ran through the crowd. Dont you fret, Calpurnia whispered to me, but theroses on her hat trembled indignantly.

When Lula came up the pathway toward us Calpurnia said, Stop right there, nigger.

Lula stopped, but she said, You aint got no business bringin white chillun heretheygot their church, we got ourn. It is our church, aint it, Miss Cal?

Calpurnia said, Its the same God, aint it?

Jem said, Lets go home, Cal, they dont want us here

I agreed: they did not want us here. I sensed, rather than saw, that we were beingadvanced upon. They seemed to be drawing closer to us, but when I looked up atCalpurnia there was amusement in her eyes. When I looked down the pathway again,Lula was gone. In her place was a solid mass of colored people.

One of them stepped from the crowd. It was Zeebo, the garbage collector. MisterJem, he said, were mighty glad to have you all here. Dont pay no tention to Lula,shes contentious because Reverend Sykes threatened to church her. Shes atroublemaker from way back, got fancy ideas an haughty wayswere mighty glad tohave you all.

With that, Calpurnia led us to the church door where we were greeted by ReverendSykes, who led us to the front pew.

First Purchase was unceiled and unpainted within. Along its walls unlighted kerosenelamps hung on brass brackets; pine benches served as pews. Behind the rough oakpulpit a faded pink silk banner proclaimed God Is Love, the churchs only decorationexcept a rotogravure print of Hunts The Light of the World. There was no sign of piano,organ, hymn-books, church programsthe familiar ecclesiastical impedimenta we sawevery Sunday. It was dim inside, with a damp coolness slowly dispelled by the gatheringcongregation. At each seat was a cheap cardboard fan bearing a garish Garden ofGethsemane, courtesy Tyndals Hardware Co. (You-Name-It-We-Sell-It).

Calpurnia motioned Jem and me to the end of the row and placed herself between us.

She fished in her purse, drew out her handkerchief, and untied the hard wad of changein its corner. She gave a dime to me and a dime to Jem. Weve got ours, hewhispered. You keep it, Calpurnia said, youre my company. Jems face showed briefindecision on the ethics of withholding his own dime, but his innate courtesy won and heshifted his dime to his pocket. I did likewise with no qualms.

Cal, I whispered, where are the hymn-books?

We dont have any, she said.

Well how?

Sh-h, she said. Reverend Sykes was standing behind the pulpit staring thecongregation to silence. He was a short, stocky man in a black suit, black tie, white shirt,and a gold watch-chain that glinted in the light from the frosted windows.

He said, Brethren and sisters, we are particularly glad to have company with us thismorning. Mister and Miss Finch. You all know their father. Before I begin I will readsome announcements.

Reverend Sykes shuffled some papers, chose one and held it at arms length. TheMissionary Society meets in the home of Sister Annette Reeves next Tuesday. Bringyour sewing.

He read from another paper. You all know of Brother Tom Robinsons trouble. He hasbeen a faithful member of First Purchase since he was a boy. The collection taken uptoday and for the next three Sundays will go to Helenhis wife, to help her out athome.

I punched Jem. Thats the Tom Atticuss de

Sh-h!

I turned to Calpurnia but was hushed before I opened my mouth. Subdued, I fixed myattention upon Reverend Sykes, who seemed to be waiting for me to settle down. Willthe music superintendent lead us in the first hymn, he said.

Zeebo rose from his pew and walked down the center aisle, stopping in front of us andfacing the congregation. He was carrying a battered hymn-book. He opened it and said,Well sing number two seventy-three.

This was too much for me. Howre we gonna sing it if there aint any hymn-books?

Calpurnia smiled. Hush baby, she whispered, youll see in a minute.

Zeebo cleared his throat and read in a voice like the rumble of distant artillery:

Theres a land beyond the river.

Miraculously on pitch, a hundred voices sang out Zeebos words. The last syllable,held to a husky hum, was followed by Zeebo saying, That we call the sweet forever.

Music again swelled around us; the last note lingered and Zeebo met it with the nextline: And we only reach that shore by faiths decree.

The congregation hesitated, Zeebo repeated the line carefully, and it was sung. At thechorus Zeebo closed the book, a signal for the congregation to proceed without his help.

On the dying notes of Jubilee, Zeebo said, In that far-off sweet forever, just beyondthe shining river.

Line for line, voices followed in simple harmony until the hymn ended in a melancholymurmur.

I looked at Jem, who was looking at Zeebo from the corners of his eyes. I didntbelieve it either, but we had both heard it.

Reverend Sykes then called on the Lord to bless the sick and the suffering, aprocedure no different from our church practice, except Reverend Sykes directed theDeitys attention to several specific cases.

His sermon was a forthright denunciation of sin, an austere declaration of the motto onthe wall behind him: he warned his flock against the evils of heady brews, gambling, andstrange women. Bootleggers caused enough trouble in the Quarters, but women wereworse. Again, as I had often met it in my own church, I was confronted with the Impurityof Women doctrine that seemed to preoccupy all clergymen.

Jem and I had heard the same sermon Sunday after Sunday, with only one exception.

Reverend Sykes used his pulpit more freely to express his views on individual lapsesfrom grace: Jim Hardy had been absent from church for five Sundays and he wasntsick; Constance Jackson had better watch her waysshe was in grave danger forquarreling with her neighbors; she had erected the only spite fence in the history of theQuarters.

Reverend Sykes closed his sermon. He stood beside a table in front of the pulpit andrequested the morning offering, a proceeding that was strange to Jem and me. One byone, the congregation came forward and dropped nickels and dimes into a blackenameled coffee can. Jem and I followed suit, and received a soft, Thank you, thankyou, as our dimes clinked.

To our amazement, Reverend Sykes emptied the can onto the table and raked thecoins into his hand. He straightened up and said, This is not enough, we must have tendollars.

The congregation stirred. You all know what its forHelen cant leave those childrento work while Toms in jail. If everybody gives one more dime, well have it ReverendSykes waved his hand and called to someone in the back of the church. Alec, shut thedoors. Nobody leaves here till we have ten dollars.

Calpurnia scratched in her handbag and brought forth a battered leather coin purse.

Naw Cal, Jem whispered, when she handed him a shiny quarter, we can put ours in.

Gimme your dime, Scout.

The church was becoming stuffy, and it occurred to me that Reverend Sykes intendedto sweat the amount due out of his flock. Fans crackled, feet shuffled, tobacco-chewerswere in agony.

Reverend Sykes startled me by saying sternly, Carlow Richardson, I havent seenyou up this aisle yet.

A thin man in khaki pants came up the aisle and deposited a coin. The congregationmurmured approval.

Reverend Sykes then said, I want all of you with no children to make a sacrifice andgive one more dime apiece. Then well have it.

Slowly, painfully, the ten dollars was collected. The door was opened, and the gust ofwarm air revived us. Zeebo lined On Jordans Stormy Banks, and church was over.

I wanted to stay and explore, but Calpurnia propelled me up the aisle ahead of her. Atthe church door, while she paused to talk with Zeebo and his family, Jem and I chattedwith Reverend Sykes. I was bursting with questions, but decided I would wait and letCalpurnia answer them.

We were specially glad to have you all here, said Reverend Sykes. This church hasno better friend than your daddy.

My curiosity burst: Why were you all takin up collection for Tom Robinsons wife?

Didnt you hear why? asked Reverend Sykes. Helens got three littleuns and shecant go out to work

Why cant she take em with her, Reverend? I asked. It was customary for fieldNegroes with tiny children to deposit them in whatever shade there was while theirparents workedusually the babies sat in the shade between two rows of cotton. Thoseunable to sit were strapped papoose-style on their mothers backs, or resided in extracotton bags.

Reverend Sykes hesitated. To tell you the truth, Miss Jean Louise, Helens finding ithard to get work these days when its picking time, I think Mr. Link Deasll take her.

Why not, Reverend?

Before he could answer, I felt Calpurnias hand on my shoulder. At its pressure I said,We thank you for lettin us come. Jem echoed me, and we made our way homeward.

Cal, I know Tom Robinsons in jail an hes done somethin awful, but why wont folkshire Helen? I asked.

Calpurnia, in her navy voile dress and tub of a hat, walked between Jem and me. Itsbecause of what folks say Toms done, she said. Folks arent anxious toto haveanything to do with any of his family.

Just what did he do, Cal?

Calpurnia sighed. Old Mr. Bob Ewell accused him of rapin his girl an had himarrested an put in jail

Mr. Ewell? My memory stirred. Does he have anything to do with those Ewells thatcome every first day of school an then go home? Why, Atticus said they were absolutetrashI never heard Atticus talk about folks the way he talked about the Ewells. Hesaid-

Yeah, those are the ones.

Well, if everybody in Maycomb knows what kind of folks the Ewells are theyd be gladto hire Helen whats rape, Cal?

Its somethin youll have to ask Mr. Finch about, she said. He can explain it betterthan I can. You all hungry? The Reverend took a long time unwindin this morning, hesnot usually so tedious.

Hes just like our preacher, said Jem, but why do you all sing hymns that way?

Linin? she asked.

Is that what it is?

Yeah, its called linin. Theyve done it that way as long as I can remember.

Jem said it looked like they could save the collection money for a year and get somehymn-books.

Calpurnia laughed. Wouldnt do any good, she said. They cant read.

Cant read? I asked. All those folks?

Thats right, Calpurnia nodded. Cant but about four folks in First Purchase readIm one of em.

Whered you go to school, Cal? asked Jem.

Nowhere. Lets see now, who taught me my letters? It was Miss Maudie Atkinsonsaunt, old Miss Buford

Are you that old?

Im older than Mr. Finch, even. Calpurnia grinned. Not sure how much, though. Westarted rememberin one time, trying to figure out how old I wasI can remember backjust a few years moren he can, so Im not much older, when you take off the fact thatmen cant remember as well as women.

Whats your birthday, Cal?

I just have it on Christmas, its easier to remember that wayI dont have a realbirthday.

But Cal, Jem protested, you dont look even near as old as Atticus.

Colored folks dont show their ages so fast, she said.

Maybe because they cant read. Cal, did you teach Zeebo?

Yeah, Mister Jem. There wasnt a school even when he was a boy. I made him learn,though.

Zeebo was Calpurnias eldest son. If I had ever thought about it, I would have knownthat Calpurnia was of mature yearsZeebo had half-grown childrenbut then I hadnever thought about it.

Did you teach him out of a primer, like us? I asked.

No, I made him get a page of the Bible every day, and there was a book Miss Bufordtaught me out ofbet you dont know where I got it, she said.

We didnt know.

Calpurnia said, Your Granddaddy Finch gave it to me.

Were you from the Landing? Jem asked. You never told us that.

I certainly am, Mister Jem. Grew up down there between the Buford Place and theLandin. Ive spent all my days workin for the Finches or the Bufords, an I moved toMaycomb when your daddy and your mamma married.

What was the book, Cal? I asked.

Blackstones Commentaries.

Jem was thunderstruck. You mean you taught Zeebo outa that?

Why yes sir, Mister Jem. Calpurnia timidly put her fingers to her mouth. They werethe only books I had. Your grandaddy said Mr. Blackstone wrote fine English

Thats why you dont talk like the rest of em, said Jem.

The rest of who?

Rest of the colored folks. Cal, but you talked like they did in church

That Calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me. The idea that she had aseparate existence outside our household was a novel one, to say nothing of her havingcommand of two languages. Cal, I asked, why do you talk nigger-talk to theto yourfolks when you know its not right?

Well, in the first place Im black

That doesnt mean you hafta talk that way when you know better, said Jem.

Calpurnia tilted her hat and scratched her head, then pressed her hat down carefullyover her ears. Its right hard to say, she said. Suppose you and Scout talked colored-folks talk at home itd be out of place, wouldnt it? Now what if I talked white-folks talk atchurch, and with my neighbors? Theyd think I was puttin on airs to beat Moses.

But Cal, you know better, I said.

Its not necessary to tell all you know. Its not ladylikein the second place, folksdont like to have somebody around knowin more than they do. It aggravates em.

Youre not gonna change any of them by talkin right, theyve got to want to learnthemselves, and when they dont want to learn theres nothing you can do but keep yourmouth shut or talk their language.

Cal, can I come to see you sometimes?

She looked down at me. See me, honey? You see me every day.

Out to your house, I said. Sometimes after work? Atticus can get me.

Any time you want to, she said. Wed be glad to have you.

We were on the sidewalk by the Radley Place.

Look on the porch yonder, Jem said.

I looked over to the Radley Place, expecting to see its phantom occupant sunninghimself in the swing. The swing was empty.

I mean our porch, said Jem.

I looked down the street. Enarmored, upright, uncompromising, Aunt Alexandra wassitting in a rocking chair exactly as if she had sat there every day of her life.


Chapter 13

Put my bag in the front bedroom, Calpurnia, was the first thing Aunt Alexandra said.

Jean Louise, stop scratching your head, was the second thing she said.

Calpurnia picked up Auntys heavy suitcase and opened the door. Ill take it, saidJem, and took it. I heard the suitcase hit the bedroom floor with a thump. The sound hada dull permanence about it. Have you come for a visit, Aunty? I asked. AuntAlexandras visits from the Landing were rare, and she traveled in state. She owned abright green square Buick and a black chauffeur, both kept in an unhealthy state oftidiness, but today they were nowhere to be seen.

Didnt your father tell you? she asked.

Jem and I shook our heads.

Probably he forgot. Hes not in yet, is he?

Nome, he doesnt usually get back till late afternoon, said Jem.

Well, your father and I decided it was time I came to stay with you for a while.

For a while in Maycomb meant anything from three days to thirty years. Jem and Iexchanged glances.

Jems growing up now and you are too, she said to me. We decided that it would bebest for you to have some feminine influence. It wont be many years, Jean Louise,before you become interested in clothes and boys

I could have made several answers to this: Cals a girl, it would be many years beforeI would be interested in boys, I would never be interested in clothes but I kept quiet.

What about Uncle Jimmy? asked Jem. Is he comin, too?

Oh no, hes staying at the Landing. Hell keep the place going.

The moment I said, Wont you miss him? I realized that this was not a tactfulquestion. Uncle Jimmy present or Uncle Jimmy absent made not much difference, henever said anything. Aunt Alexandra ignored my question.

I could think of nothing else to say to her. In fact I could never think of anything to sayto her, and I sat thinking of past painful conversations between us: How are you, JeanLouise? Fine, thank you maam, how are you? Very well, thank you, what have youbeen doing with yourself? Nothin. Dont you do anything? Nome. Certainly you havefriends? Yessum. Well what do you all do? Nothin.

It was plain that Aunty thought me dull in the extreme, because I once heard her tellAtticus that I was sluggish.

There was a story behind all this, but I had no desire to extract it from her then. Todaywas Sunday, and Aunt Alexandra was positively irritable on the Lords Day. I guess itwas her Sunday corset. She was not fat, but solid, and she chose protective garmentsthat drew up her bosom to giddy heights, pinched in her waist, flared out her rear, andmanaged to suggest that Aunt Alexandras was once an hour-glass figure. From anyangle, it was formidable.

The remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that descends whenrelatives appear, but was dispelled when we heard a car turn in the driveway. It wasAtticus, home from Montgomery. Jem, forgetting his dignity, ran with me to meet him.

Jem seized his briefcase and bag, I jumped into his arms, felt his vague dry kiss andsaid, d you bring me a book? d you know Auntys here?

Atticus answered both questions in the affirmative. Howd you like for her to come livewith us?

I said I would like it very much, which was a lie, but one must lie under certaincircumstances and at all times when one cant do anything about them.

We felt it was time you children neededwell, its like this, Scout, Atticus said. Youraunts doing me a favor as well as you all. I cant stay here all day with you, and thesummers going to be a hot one.

Yes sir, I said, not understanding a word he said. I had an idea, however, that AuntAlexandras appearance on the scene was not so much Atticuss doing as hers. Auntyhad a way of declaring What Is Best For The Family, and I suppose her coming to livewith us was in that category.

Maycomb welcomed her. Miss Maudie Atkinson baked a Lane cake so loaded withshinny it made me tight; Miss Stephanie Crawford had long visits with Aunt Alexandra,consisting mostly of Miss Stephanie shaking her head and saying, Uh, uh, uh. MissRachel next door had Aunty over for coffee in the afternoons, and Mr. Nathan Radleywent so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was glad to see her.

When she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, Aunt Alexandra seemedas if she had always lived with us. Her Missionary Society refreshments added to herreputation as a hostess (she did not permit Calpurnia to make the delicacies required tosustain the Society through long reports on Rice Christians); she joined and becameSecretary of the Maycomb Amanuensis Club. To all parties present and participating inthe life of the county, Aunt Alexandra was one of the last of her kind: she had river-boat,boarding-school manners; let any moral come along and she would uphold it; she wasborn in the objective case; she was an incurable gossip. When Aunt Alexandra went toschool, self-doubt could not be found in any textbook, so she knew not its meaning. Shewas never bored, and given the slightest chance she would exercise her royalprerogative: she would arrange, advise, caution, and warn.

She never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcomings of other tribal groupsto the greater glory of our own, a habit that amused Jem rather than annoyed him:

Aunty better watch how she talksscratch most folks in Maycomb and theyre kin tous.

Aunt Alexandra, in underlining the moral of young Sam Merriweathers suicide, said itwas caused by a morbid streak in the family. Let a sixteen-year-old girl giggle in thechoir and Aunty would say, It just goes to show you, all the Penfield women are flighty.

Everybody in Maycomb, it seemed, had a Streak: a Drinking Streak, a Gambling Streak,a Mean Streak, a Funny Streak.

Once, when Aunty assured us that Miss Stephanie Crawfords tendency to mind otherpeoples business was hereditary, Atticus said, Sister, when you stop to think about it,our generations practically the first in the Finch family not to marry its cousins. Wouldyou say the Finches have an Incestuous Streak?

Aunty said no, thats where we got our small hands and feet.

I never understood her preoccupation with heredity. Somewhere, I had received theimpression that Fine Folks were people who did the best they could with the sense theyhad, but Aunt Alexandra was of the opinion, obliquely expressed, that the longer afamily had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it was.

That makes the Ewells fine folks, then, said Jem. The tribe of which Burris Ewell andhis brethren consisted had lived on the same plot of earth behind the Maycomb dump,and had thrived on county welfare money for three generations.

Aunt Alexandras theory had something behind it, though. Maycomb was an ancienttown. It was twenty miles east of Finchs Landing, awkwardly inland for such an oldtown. But Maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not been for the nimble-wittedness of one Sinkfield, who in the dawn of history operated an inn where two pig-trails met, the only tavern in the territory. Sinkfield, no patriot, served and suppliedammunition to Indians and settlers alike, neither knowing or caring whether he was apart of the Alabama Territory or the Creek Nation so long as business was good.

Business was excellent when Governor William Wyatt Bibb, with a view to promoting thenewly created countys domestic tranquility, dispatched a team of surveyors to locate itsexact center and there establish its seat of government. The surveyors, Sinkfieldsguests, told their host that he was in the territorial confines of Maycomb County, andshowed him the probable spot where the county seat would be built. Had not Sinkfieldmade a bold stroke to preserve his holdings, Maycomb would have sat in the middle ofWinston Swamp, a place totally devoid of interest. Instead, Maycomb grew andsprawled out from its hub, Sinkfields Tavern, because Sinkfield reduced his guests tomyopic drunkenness one evening, induced them to bring forward their maps and charts,lop off a little here, add a bit there, and adjust the center of the county to meet hisrequirements. He sent them packing next day armed with their charts and five quarts ofshinny in their saddlebagstwo apiece and one for the Governor.

Because its primary reason for existence was government, Maycomb was spared thegrubbiness that distinguished most Alabama towns its size. In the beginning its buildingswere solid, its courthouse proud, its streets graciously wide. Maycombs proportion ofprofessional people ran high: one went there to have his teeth pulled, his wagon fixed,his heart listened to, his money deposited, his soul saved, his mules vetted. But theultimate wisdom of Sinkfields maneuver is open to question. He placed the young towntoo far away from the only kind of public transportation in those daysriver-boatand ittook a man from the north end of the county two days to travel to Maycomb for store-bought goods. As a result the town remained the same size for a hundred years, anisland in a patchwork sea of cottonfields and timberland.

Although Maycomb was ignored during the War Between the States, Reconstructionrule and economic ruin forced the town to grow. It grew inward. New people so rarelysettled there, the same families married the same families until the members of thecommunity looked faintly alike. Occasionally someone would return from Montgomery orMobile with an outsider, but the result caused only a ripple in the quiet stream of familyresemblance. Things were more or less the same during my early years.

There was indeed a caste system in Maycomb, but to my mind it worked this way: theolder citizens, the present generation of people who had lived side by side for years andyears, were utterly predictable to one another: they took for granted attitudes, charactershadings, even gestures, as having been repeated in each generation and refined bytime. Thus the dicta No Crawford Minds His Own Business, Every Third Merriweather IsMorbid, The Truth Is Not in the Delafields, All the Bufords Walk Like That, were simplyguides to daily living: never take a check from a Delafield without a discreet call to thebank; Miss Maudie Atkinsons shoulder stoops because she was a Buford; if Mrs. GraceMerriweather sips gin out of Lydia E. Pinkham bottles its nothing unusualher motherdid the same.

Aunt Alexandra fitted into the world of Maycomb like a hand into a glove, but neverinto the world of Jem and me. I so often wondered how she could be Atticuss and UncleJacks sister that I revived half-remembered tales of changelings and mandrake rootsthat Jem had spun long ago.

These were abstract speculations for the first month of her stay, as she had little tosay to Jem or me, and we saw her only at mealtimes and at night before we went tobed. It was summer and we were outdoors. Of course some afternoons when I wouldrun inside for a drink of water, I would find the livingroom overrun with Maycomb ladies,sipping, whispering, fanning, and I would be called: Jean Louise, come speak to theseladies.

When I appeared in the doorway, Aunty would look as if she regretted her request; Iwas usually mud-splashed or covered with sand.

Speak to your Cousin Lily, she said one afternoon, when she had trapped me in thehall.

Who? I said.

Your Cousin Lily Brooke, said Aunt Alexandra.

She our cousin? I didnt know that.

Aunt Alexandra managed to smile in a way that conveyed a gentle apology to CousinLily and firm disapproval to me. When Cousin Lily Brooke left I knew I was in for it.

It was a sad thing that my father had neglected to tell me about the Finch Family, or toinstall any pride into his children. She summoned Jem, who sat warily on the sofabeside me. She left the room and returned with a purple-covered book on whichMeditations of Joshua S. St. Clair was stamped in gold.

Your cousin wrote this, said Aunt Alexandra. He was a beautiful character.

Jem examined the small volume. Is this the Cousin Joshua who was locked up for solong?

Aunt Alexandra said, How did you know that?

Why, Atticus said he went round the bend at the University. Said he tried to shoot thepresident. Said Cousin Joshua said he wasnt anything but a sewer-inspector and triedto shoot him with an old flintlock pistol, only it just blew up in his hand. Atticus said itcost the family five hundred dollars to get him out of that one

Aunt Alexandra was standing stiff as a stork. Thats all, she said. Well see aboutthis.

Before bedtime I was in Jems room trying to borrow a book, when Atticus knockedand entered. He sat on the side of Jems bed, looked at us soberly, then he grinned.

Erhrm, he said. He was beginning to preface some things he said with a throatynoise, and I thought he must at last be getting old, but he looked the same. I dontexactly know how to say this, he began.

Well, just say it, said Jem. Have we done something?

Our father was actually fidgeting. No, I just want to explain to you thatyour AuntAlexandra asked me son, you know youre a Finch, dont you?

Thats what Ive been told. Jem looked out of the corners of his eyes. His voice roseuncontrollably, Atticus, whats the matter?

Atticus crossed his knees and folded his arms. Im trying to tell you the facts of life.

Jems disgust deepened. I know all that stuff, he said.

Atticus suddenly grew serious. In his lawyers voice, without a shade of inflection, hesaid: Your aunt has asked me to try and impress upon you and Jean Louise that youare not from run-of-the-mill people, that you are the product of several generations

gentle breeding Atticus paused, watching me locate an elusive redbug on my leg.

Gentle breeding, he continued, when I had found and scratched it, and that youshould try to live up to your name Atticus persevered in spite of us: She asked me totell you you must try to behave like the little lady and gentleman that you are. She wantsto talk to you about the family and what its meant to Maycomb County through theyears, so youll have some idea of who you are, so you might be moved to behaveaccordingly, he concluded at a gallop.

Stunned, Jem and I looked at each other, then at Atticus, whose collar seemed toworry him. We did not speak to him.

Presently I picked up a comb from Jems dresser and ran its teeth along the edge.

Stop that noise, Atticus said.

His curtness stung me. The comb was midway in its journey, and I banged it down.

For no reason I felt myself beginning to cry, but I could not stop. This was not my father.

My father never thought these thoughts. My father never spoke so. Aunt Alexandra hadput him up to this, somehow. Through my tears I saw Jem standing in a similar pool ofisolation, his head cocked to one side.

There was nowhere to go, but I turned to go and met Atticuss vest front. I buried myhead in it and listened to the small internal noises that went on behind the light bluecloth: his watch ticking, the faint crackle of his starched shirt, the soft sound of hisbreathing.

Your stomachs growling, I said.

I know it, he said.

You better take some soda.

I will, he said.

Atticus, is all this behavin an stuff gonna make things different? I mean are you?

I felt his hand on the back of my head. Dont you worry about anything, he said. Itsnot time to worry. When I heard that, I knew he had come back to us. The blood in mylegs began to flow again, and I raised my head. You really want us to do all that? I cantremember everything Finches are supposed to do

I dont want you to remember it. Forget it.

He went to the door and out of the room, shutting the door behind him. He nearlyslammed it, but caught himself at the last minute and closed it softly. As Jem and Istared, the door opened again and Atticus peered around. His eyebrows were raised,his glasses had slipped. Get more like Cousin Joshua every day, dont I? Do you thinkIll end up costing the family five hundred dollars?

I know now what he was trying to do, but Atticus was only a man. It takes a woman todo that kind of work.


Chapter 14

Although we heard no more about the Finch family from Aunt Alexandra, we heardplenty from the town. On Saturdays, armed with our nickels, when Jem permitted me toaccompany him (he was now positively allergic to my presence when in public), wewould squirm our way through sweating sidewalk crowds and sometimes hear, Thereshis chillun, or, Yonders some Finches. Turning to face our accusers, we would seeonly a couple of farmers studying the enema bags in the Mayco Drugstore window. Ortwo dumpy countrywomen in straw hats sitting in a Hoover cart.

They cn go loose and rape up the countryside for all of em who run this countycare, was one obscure observation we met head on from a skinny gentleman when hepassed us. Which reminded me that I had a question to ask Atticus.

Whats rape? I asked him that night.

Atticus looked around from behind his paper. He was in his chair by the window. Aswe grew older, Jem and I thought it generous to allow Atticus thirty minutes to himselfafter supper.

He sighed, and said rape was carnal knowledge of a female by force and withoutconsent.

Well if thats all it is why did Calpurnia dry me up when I asked her what it was?

Atticus looked pensive. Whats that again?

Well, I asked Calpurnia comin from church that day what it was and she said ask youbut I forgot to and now Im askin you.

His paper was now in his lap. Again, please, he said.

I told him in detail about our trip to church with Calpurnia. Atticus seemed to enjoy it,but Aunt Alexandra, who was sitting in a corner quietly sewing, put down her embroideryand stared at us.

You all were coming back from Calpurnias church that Sunday?

Jem said, Yessum, she took us.

I remembered something. Yessum, and she promised me I could come out to herhouse some afternoon. Atticus. Ill go next Sunday if its all right, can I? Cal said shedcome get me if you were off in the car.

You may not.

Aunt Alexandra said it. I wheeled around, startled, then turned back to Atticus in timeto catch his swift glance at her, but it was too late. I said, I didnt ask you!

For a big man, Atticus could get up and down from a chair faster than anyone I everknew. He was on his feet. Apologize to your aunt, he said.

I didnt ask her, I asked you

Atticus turned his head and pinned me to the wall with his good eye. His voice wasdeadly: First, apologize to your aunt.

Im sorry, Aunty, I muttered.

Now then, he said. Lets get this clear: you do as Calpurnia tells you, you do as I tellyou, and as long as your aunts in this house, you will do as she tells you. Understand?

I understood, pondered a while, and concluded that the only way I could retire with ashred of dignity was to go to the bathroom, where I stayed long enough to make themthink I had to go. Returning, I lingered in the hall to hear a fierce discussion going on inthe livingroom. Through the door I could see Jem on the sofa with a football magazine infront of his face, his head turning as if its pages contained a live tennis match.

youve got to do something about her, Aunty was saying. Youve let things go ontoo long, Atticus, too long.

I dont see any harm in letting her go out there. Cald look after her there as well asshe does here.

Who was the her they were talking about? My heart sank: me. I felt the starchedwalls of a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on me, and for the second time in my life Ithought of running away. Immediately.

Atticus, its all right to be soft-hearted, youre an easy man, but you have a daughterto think of. A daughter whos growing up.

Thats what I am thinking of.

And dont try to get around it. Youve got to face it sooner or later and it might as wellbe tonight. We dont need her now.

Atticuss voice was even: Alexandra, Calpurnias not leaving this house until shewants to. You may think otherwise, but I couldnt have got along without her all theseyears. Shes a faithful member of this family and youll simply have to accept things theway they are. Besides, sister, I dont want you working your head off for usyouve noreason to do that. We still need Cal as much as we ever did.

But Atticus

Besides, I dont think the childrenve suffered one bit from her having brought themup. If anything, shes been harder on them in some ways than a mother would havebeen shes never let them get away with anything, shes never indulged them the waymost colored nurses do. She tried to bring them up according to her lights, and Calslights are pretty goodand another thing, the children love her.

I breathed again. It wasnt me, it was only Calpurnia they were talking about. Revived,I entered the livingroom. Atticus had retreated behind his newspaper and AuntAlexandra was worrying her embroidery. Punk, punk, punk, her needle broke the tautcircle. She stopped, and pulled the cloth tighter: punk-punk-punk. She was furious.

Jem got up and padded across the rug. He motioned me to follow. He led me to hisroom and closed the door. His face was grave.

Theyve been fussing, Scout.

Jem and I fussed a great deal these days, but I had never heard of or seen anyonequarrel with Atticus. It was not a comfortable sight.

Scout, try not to antagonize Aunty, hear?

Atticuss remarks were still rankling, which made me miss the request in Jemsquestion. My feathers rose again. You tryin to tell me what to do?

Naw, itshes got a lot on his mind now, without us worrying him.

Like what? Atticus didnt appear to have anything especially on his mind.

Its this Tom Robinson case thats worryin him to death

I said Atticus didnt worry about anything. Besides, the case never bothered us exceptabout once a week and then it didnt last.

Thats because you cant hold something in your mind but a little while, said Jem.

Its different with grown folks, we

His maddening superiority was unbearable these days. He didnt want to do anythingbut read and go off by himself. Still, everything he read he passed along to me, but withthis difference: formerly, because he thought Id like it; now, for my edification andinstruction.

Jee crawling hova, Jem! Who do you think you are?

Now I mean it, Scout, you antagonize Aunty and IllIll spank you.

With that, I was gone. You damn morphodite, Ill kill you! He was sitting on the bed,and it was easy to grab his front hair and land one on his mouth. He slapped me and Itried another left, but a punch in the stomach sent me sprawling on the floor. It nearlyknocked the breath out of me, but it didnt matter because I knew he was fighting, hewas fighting me back. We were still equals.

Aint so high and mighty now, are you! I screamed, sailing in again. He was still onthe bed and I couldnt get a firm stance, so I threw myself at him as hard as I could,hitting, pulling, pinching, gouging. What had begun as a fist-fight became a brawl. Wewere still struggling when Atticus separated us.

Thats all, he said. Both of you go to bed right now.

Taah! I said at Jem. He was being sent to bed at my bedtime.

Who started it? asked Atticus, in resignation.

Jem did. He was tryin to tell me what to do. I dont have to mind him now, do I?

Atticus smiled. Lets leave it at this: you mind Jem whenever he can make you. Fairenough?

Aunt Alexandra was present but silent, and when she went down the hall with Atticuswe heard her say, just one of the things Ive been telling you about, a phrase thatunited us again.

Ours were adjoining rooms; as I shut the door between them Jem said, Night, Scout.

Night, I murmured, picking my way across the room to turn on the light. As I passedthe bed I stepped on something warm, resilient, and rather smooth. It was not quite likehard rubber, and I had the sensation that it was alive. I also heard it move.

I switched on the light and looked at the floor by the bed. Whatever I had stepped onwas gone. I tapped on Jems door.

What, he said.

How does a snake feel?

Sort of rough. Cold. Dusty. Why?

I think theres one under my bed. Can you come look?

Are you bein funny? Jem opened the door. He was in his pajama bottoms. I noticednot without satisfaction that the mark of my knuckles was still on his mouth. When hesaw I meant what I said, he said, If you think Im gonna put my face down to a snakeyouve got another think comin. Hold on a minute.

He went to the kitchen and fetched the broom. You better get up on the bed, he said.

You reckon its really one? I asked. This was an occasion. Our houses had nocellars; they were built on stone blocks a few feet above the ground, and the entry ofreptiles was not unknown but was not commonplace. Miss Rachel Haverfords excusefor a glass of neat whiskey every morning was that she never got over the fright offinding a rattler coiled in her bedroom closet, on her washing, when she went to hang upher negligee.

Jem made a tentative swipe under the bed. I looked over the foot to see if a snakewould come out. None did. Jem made a deeper swipe.

Do snakes grunt?

It aint a snake, Jem said. Its somebody.

Suddenly a filthy brown package shot from under the bed. Jem raised the broom andmissed Dills head by an inch when it appeared.

God Almighty. Jems voice was reverent.

We watched Dill emerge by degrees. He was a tight fit. He stood up and eased hisshoulders, turned his feet in their ankle sockets, rubbed the back of his neck. Hiscirculation restored, he said, Hey.

Jem petitioned God again. I was speechless.

Im bout to perish, said Dill. Got anything to eat?

In a dream, I went to the kitchen. I brought him back some milk and half a pan of cornbread left over from supper. Dill devoured it, chewing with his front teeth, as was hiscustom.

I finally found my voice. Howd you get here?

By an involved route. Refreshed by food, Dill recited this narrative: having been boundin chains and left to die in the basement (there were basements in Meridian) by his newfather, who disliked him, and secretly kept alive on raw field peas by a passing farmerwho heard his cries for help (the good man poked a bushel pod by pod through theventilator), Dill worked himself free by pulling the chains from the wall. Still in wristmanacles, he wandered two miles out of Meridian where he discovered a small animalshow and was immediately engaged to wash the camel. He traveled with the show allover Mississippi until his infallible sense of direction told him he was in Abbott County,Alabama, just across the river from Maycomb. He walked the rest of the way.

Howd you get here? asked Jem.

He had taken thirteen dollars from his mothers purse, caught the nine oclock fromMeridian and got off at Maycomb Junction. He had walked ten or eleven of the fourteenmiles to Maycomb, off the highway in the scrub bushes lest the authorities be seekinghim, and had ridden the remainder of the way clinging to the backboard of a cottonwagon. He had been under the bed for two hours, he thought; he had heard us in thediningroom, and the clink of forks on plates nearly drove him crazy. He thought Jem andI would never go to bed; he had considered emerging and helping me beat Jem, as Jemhad grown far taller, but he knew Mr. Finch would break it up soon, so he thought it bestto stay where he was. He was worn out, dirty beyond belief, and home.

They must not know youre here, said Jem. Wed know if they were lookin foryou

Think theyre still searchin all the picture shows in Meridian. Dill grinned.

You oughta let your mother know where you are, said Jem. You oughta let her knowyoure here

Dills eyes flickered at Jem, and Jem looked at the floor. Then he rose and broke theremaining code of our childhood. He went out of the room and down the hall. Atticus,

his voice was distant, can you come here a minute, sir?

Beneath its sweat-streaked dirt Dills face went white. I felt sick. Atticus was in thedoorway.

He came to the middle of the room and stood with his hands in his pockets, lookingdown at Dill.

I finally found my voice: Its okay, Dill. When he wants you to know somethin, he tellsyou.

Dill looked at me. I mean its all right, I said. You know he wouldnt bother you, youknow you aint scared of Atticus.

Im not scared Dill muttered.

Just hungry, Ill bet. Atticuss voice had its usual pleasant dryness. Scout, we can dobetter than a pan of cold corn bread, cant we? You fill this fellow up and when I getback well see what we can see.

Mr. Finch, dont tell Aunt Rachel, dont make me go back, please sir! Ill run offagain!

Whoa, son, said Atticus. Nobodys about to make you go anywhere but to bed prettysoon. Im just going over to tell Miss Rachel youre here and ask her if you could spendthe night with usyoud like that, wouldnt you? And for goodness sake put some of thecounty back where it belongs, the soil erosions bad enough as it is.

Dill stared at my fathers retreating figure.

Hes tryin to be funny, I said. He means take a bath. See there, I told you hewouldnt bother you.

Jem was standing in a corner of the room, looking like the traitor he was. Dill, I had totell him, he said. You cant run three hundred miles off without your mother knowin.

We left him without a word.

Dill ate, and ate, and ate. He hadnt eaten since last night. He used all his money for aticket, boarded the train as he had done many times, coolly chatted with the conductor,to whom Dill was a familiar sight, but he had not the nerve to invoke the rule on smallchildren traveling a distance alone if youve lost your money the conductor will lend youenough for dinner and your father will pay him back at the end of the line.

Dill made his way through the leftovers and was reaching for a can of pork and beansin the pantry when Miss Rachels Do-oo Je-sus went off in the hall. He shivered like arabbit.

He bore with fortitude her Wait Till I Get You Home, Your Folks Are Out of Their MindsWorryin, was quite calm during Thats All the Harris in You Coming Out, smiled at herReckon You Can Stay One Night, and returned the hug at long last bestowed upon him.

Atticus pushed up his glasses and rubbed his face.

Your fathers tired, said Aunt Alexandra, her first words in hours, it seemed. She hadbeen there, but I suppose struck dumb most of the time. You children get to bed now.

We left them in the diningroom, Atticus still mopping his face. From rape to riot torunaways, we heard him chuckle. I wonder what the next two hours will bring.

Since things appeared to have worked out pretty well, Dill and I decided to be civil toJem. Besides, Dill had to sleep with him so we might as well speak to him.

I put on my pajamas, read for a while and found myself suddenly unable to keep myeyes open. Dill and Jem were quiet; when I turned off my reading lamp there was nostrip of light under the door to Jems room.

I must have slept a long time, for when I was punched awake the room was dim withthe light of the setting moon.

Move over, Scout.

He thought he had to, I mumbled. Dont stay mad with him.

Dill got in bed beside me. I aint, he said. I just wanted to sleep with you. Are youwaked up?

By this time I was, but lazily so. Whyd you do it?

No answer. I said whyd you run off? Was he really hateful like you said?

Naw

Didnt you all build that boat like you wrote you were gonna?

He just said we would. We never did.

I raised up on my elbow, facing Dills outline. Its no reason to run off. They dont getaround to doin what they say theyre gonna do half the time

That wasnt it, hethey just wasnt interested in me.

This was the weirdest reason for flight I had ever heard. How come?

Well, they stayed gone all the time, and when they were home, even, theyd get off ina room by themselves.

Whatd they do in there?

Nothin, just sittin and readinbut they didnt want me with em.

I pushed the pillow to the headboard and sat up. You know something? I was fixin torun off tonight because there they all were. You dont want em around you all the time,Dill

Dill breathed his patient breath, a half-sigh.

good night, Atticuss gone all day and sometimes half the night and off in thelegislature and I dont know whatyou dont want em around all the time, Dill, youcouldnt do anything if they were.

Thats not it.

As Dill explained, I found myself wondering what life would be if Jem were different,even from what he was now; what I would do if Atticus did not feel the necessity of mypresence, help and advice. Why, he couldnt get along a day without me. EvenCalpurnia couldnt get along unless I was there. They needed me.

Dill, you aint telling me rightyour folks couldnt do without you. They must be justmean to you. Tell you what to do about that

Dills voice went on steadily in the darkness: The thing is, what Im tryin to say isthey do get on a lot better without me, I cant help them any. They aint mean. They buyme everything I want, but its nowyouve-got-it-go-play-with-it. Youve got a roomful ofthings. I-got-you-that-book-so-go-read-it. Dill tried to deepen his voice. Youre not aboy. Boys get out and play baseball with other boys, they dont hang around the houseworryin their folks.

Dills voice was his own again: Oh, they aint mean. They kiss you and hug you goodnight and good mornin and good-bye and tell you they love youScout, lets get us ababy.

Where?

There was a man Dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggyisland where all these babies were; you could order oneThats a lie. Aunty said God drops em down the chimney. At least thats what I thinkshe said. For once, Auntys diction had not been too clear.

Well that aint so. You get babies from each other. But theres this man, toohe hasall these babies just waitin to wake up, he breathes life into em

Dill was off again. Beautiful things floated around in his dreamy head. He could readtwo books to my one, but he preferred the magic of his own inventions. He could addand subtract faster than lightning, but he preferred his own twilight world, a world wherebabies slept, waiting to be gathered like morning lilies. He was slowly talking himself tosleep and taking me with him, but in the quietness of his foggy island there rose thefaded image of a gray house with sad brown doors.

Dill?

Mm?

Why do you reckon Boo Radleys never run off?

Dill sighed a long sigh and turned away from me.

Maybe he doesnt have anywhere to run off to.


Chapter 15

After many telephone calls, much pleading on behalf of the defendant, and a longforgiving letter from his mother, it was decided that Dill could stay. We had a week ofpeace together. After that, little, it seemed. A nightmare was upon us.

It began one evening after supper. Dill was over; Aunt Alexandra was in her chair inthe corner, Atticus was in his; Jem and I were on the floor reading. It had been a placidweek: I had minded Aunty; Jem had outgrown the treehouse, but helped Dill and meconstruct a new rope ladder for it; Dill had hit upon a foolproof plan to make Boo Radleycome out at no cost to ourselves (place a trail of lemon drops from the back door to thefront yard and hed follow it, like an ant). There was a knock on the front door, Jemanswered it and said it was Mr. Heck Tate.

Well, ask him to come in, said Atticus.

I already did. Theres some men outside in the yard, they want you to come out.

In Maycomb, grown men stood outside in the front yard for only two reasons: deathand politics. I wondered who had died. Jem and I went to the front door, but Atticuscalled, Go back in the house.

Jem turned out the livingroom lights and pressed his nose to a window screen. AuntAlexandra protested. Just for a second, Aunty, lets see who it is, he said.

Dill and I took another window. A crowd of men was standing around Atticus. They allseemed to be talking at once.

movin him to the county jail tomorrow, Mr. Tate was saying, I dont look for anytrouble, but I cant guarantee there wont be any

Dont be foolish, Heck, Atticus said. This is Maycomb.

said I was just uneasy.

Heck, weve gotten one postponement of this case just to make sure theres nothingto be uneasy about. This is Saturday, Atticus said. Trialll probably be Monday. Youcan keep him one night, cant you? I dont think anybody in Maycombll begrudge me aclient, with times this hard.

There was a murmur of glee that died suddenly when Mr. Link Deas said, Nobodyaround heres up to anything, its that Old Sarum bunch Im worried about cant youget awhat is it, Heck?

Change of venue, said Mr. Tate. Not much point in that, now is it?

Atticus said something inaudible. I turned to Jem, who waved me to silence.

besides, Atticus was saying, youre not scared of that crowd, are you?

know how they do when they get shinnied up.

They dont usually drink on Sunday, they go to church most of the day Atticus said.

This is a special occasion, though someone said.

They murmured and buzzed until Aunty said if Jem didnt turn on the livingroom lightshe would disgrace the family. Jem didnt hear her.

dont see why you touched it in the first place, Mr. Link Deas was saying. Youvegot everything to lose from this, Atticus. I mean everything.

Do you really think so?

This was Atticuss dangerous question. Do you really think you want to move there,Scout? Bam, bam, bam, and the checkerboard was swept clean of my men. Do youreally think that, son? Then read this. Jem would struggle the rest of an eveningthrough the speeches of Henry W. Grady.

Link, that boy might go to the chair, but hes not going till the truths told. Atticussvoice was even. And you know what the truth is.

There was a murmur among the group of men, made more ominous when Atticusmoved back to the bottom front step and the men drew nearer to him.

Suddenly Jem screamed, Atticus, the telephones ringing!

The men jumped a little and scattered; they were people we saw every day:

merchants, in-town farmers; Dr. Reynolds was there; so was Mr. Avery.

Well, answer it, son, called Atticus.

Laughter broke them up. When Atticus switched on the overhead light in thelivingroom he found Jem at the window, pale except for the vivid mark of the screen onhis nose.

Why on earth are you all sitting in the dark? he asked.

Jem watched him go to his chair and pick up the evening paper. I sometimes thinkAtticus subjected every crisis of his life to tranquil evaluation behind The MobileRegister, The Birmingham News and The Montgomery Advertiser.

They were after you, werent they? Jem went to him. They wanted to get you, didntthey?

Atticus lowered the paper and gazed at Jem. What have you been reading? heasked. Then he said gently, No son, those were our friends.

It wasnt aa gang? Jem was looking from the corners of his eyes.

Atticus tried to stifle a smile but didnt make it. No, we dont have mobs and thatnonsense in Maycomb. Ive never heard of a gang in Maycomb.

Ku Klux got after some Catholics one time.

Never heard of any Catholics in Maycomb either, said Atticus, youre confusing thatwith something else. Way back about nineteen-twenty there was a Klan, but it was apolitical organization more than anything. Besides, they couldnt find anybody to scare.

They paraded by Mr. Sam Levys house one night, but Sam just stood on his porch andtold em things had come to a pretty pass, hed sold em the very sheets on their backs.

Sam made em so ashamed of themselves they went away.

The Levy family met all criteria for being Fine Folks: they did the best they could withthe sense they had, and they had been living on the same plot of ground in Maycombfor five generations.

The Ku Kluxs gone, said Atticus. Itll never come back.

I walked home with Dill and returned in time to overhear Atticus saying to Aunty, infavor of Southern womanhood as much as anybody, but not for preserving polite fictionat the expense of human life, a pronouncement that made me suspect they had beenfussing again.

I sought Jem and found him in his room, on the bed deep in thought. Have they beenat it? I asked.

Sort of. She wont let him alone about Tom Robinson. She almost said Atticus wasdisgracin the family. Scout Im scared.

Scareda what?

Scared about Atticus. Somebody might hurt him. Jem preferred to remainmysterious; all he would say to my questions was go on and leave him alone.

Next day was Sunday. In the interval between Sunday School and Church when thecongregation stretched its legs, I saw Atticus standing in the yard with another knot ofmen. Mr. Heck Tate was present, and I wondered if he had seen the light. He neverwent to church. Even Mr. Underwood was there. Mr. Underwood had no use for anyorganization but The Maycomb Tribune, of which he was the sole owner, editor, andprinter. His days were spent at his linotype, where he refreshed himself occasionallyfrom an ever-present gallon jug of cherry wine. He rarely gathered news; people broughtit to him. It was said that he made up every edition of The Maycomb Tribune out of hisown head and wrote it down on the linotype. This was believable. Something must havebeen up to haul Mr. Underwood out.

I caught Atticus coming in the door, and he said that theyd moved Tom Robinson tothe Maycomb jail. He also said, more to himself than to me, that if theyd kept him therein the first place there wouldnt have been any fuss. I watched him take his seat on thethird row from the front, and I heard him rumble, Nearer my God to thee, some notesbehind the rest of us. He never sat with Aunty, Jem and me. He liked to be by himself inchurch.

The fake peace that prevailed on Sundays was made more irritating by AuntAlexandras presence. Atticus would flee to his office directly after dinner, where if wesometimes looked in on him, we would find him sitting back in his swivel chair reading.

Aunt Alexandra composed herself for a two-hour nap and dared us to make any noise inthe yard, the neighborhood was resting. Jem in his old age had taken to his room with astack of football magazines. So Dill and I spent our Sundays creeping around in DeersPasture.

Shooting on Sundays was prohibited, so Dill and I kicked Jems football around thepasture for a while, which was no fun. Dill asked if Id like to have a poke at Boo Radley.

I said I didnt think itd be nice to bother him, and spent the rest of the afternoon fillingDill in on last winters events. He was considerably impressed.

We parted at suppertime, and after our meal Jem and I were settling down to a routineevening, when Atticus did something that interested us: he came into the livingroomcarrying a long electrical extension cord. There was a light bulb on the end.

Im going out for a while, he said. You folksll be in bed when I come back, so Ill saygood night now.

With that, he put his hat on and went out the back door.

Hes takin the car, said Jem.

Our father had a few peculiarities: one was, he never ate desserts; another was thathe liked to walk. As far back as I could remember, there was always a Chevrolet inexcellent condition in the carhouse, and Atticus put many miles on it in business trips,but in Maycomb he walked to and from his office four times a day, covering about twomiles. He said his only exercise was walking. In Maycomb, if one went for a walk with nodefinite purpose in mind, it was correct to believe ones mind incapable of definitepurpose.

Later on, I bade my aunt and brother good night and was well into a book when Iheard Jem rattling around in his room. His go-to-bed noises were so familiar to me that Iknocked on his door: Why aint you going to bed?

Im goin downtown for a while. He was changing his pants.

Why? Its almost ten oclock, Jem.

He knew it, but he was going anyway.

Then Im goin with you. If you say no youre not, Im goin anyway, hear?

Jem saw that he would have to fight me to keep me home, and I suppose he thought afight would antagonize Aunty, so he gave in with little grace.

I dressed quickly. We waited until Auntys light went out, and we walked quietly downthe back steps. There was no moon tonight.

Dillll wanta come, I whispered.

So he will, said Jem gloomily.

We leaped over the driveway wall, cut through Miss Rachels side yard and went toDills window. Jem whistled bob-white. Dills face appeared at the screen, disappeared,and five minutes later he unhooked the screen and crawled out. An old campaigner, hedid not speak until we were on the sidewalk. Whats up?

Jems got the look-arounds, an affliction Calpurnia said all boys caught at his age.

Ive just got this feeling, Jem said, just this feeling.

We went by Mrs. Duboses house, standing empty and shuttered, her camellias grownup in weeds and johnson grass. There were eight more houses to the post office corner.

The south side of the square was deserted. Giant monkey-puzzle bushes bristled oneach corner, and between them an iron hitching rail glistened under the street lights. Alight shone in the county toilet, otherwise that side of the courthouse was dark. A largersquare of stores surrounded the courthouse square; dim lights burned from deep withinthem.

Atticuss office was in the courthouse when he began his law practice, but afterseveral years of it he moved to quieter quarters in the Maycomb Bank building. Whenwe rounded the corner of the square, we saw the car parked in front of the bank. Hesin there, said Jem.

But he wasnt. His office was reached by a long hallway. Looking down the hall, weshould have seen Atticus Finch, Attorney-at-Law in small sober letters against the lightfrom behind his door. It was dark.

Jem peered in the bank door to make sure. He turned the knob. The door was locked.

Lets go up the street. Maybe hes visitin Mr. Underwood.

Mr. Underwood not only ran The Maycomb Tribune office, he lived in it. That is, aboveit. He covered the courthouse and jailhouse news simply by looking out his upstairswindow. The office building was on the northwest corner of the square, and to reach itwe had to pass the jail.

The Maycomb jail was the most venerable and hideous of the countys buildings.

Atticus said it was like something Cousin Joshua St. Clair might have designed. It wascertainly someones dream. Starkly out of place in a town of square-faced stores andsteep-roofed houses, the Maycomb jail was a miniature Gothic joke one cell wide andtwo cells high, complete with tiny battlements and flying buttresses. Its fantasy washeightened by its red brick facade and the thick steel bars at its ecclesiastical windows.

It stood on no lonely hill, but was wedged between Tyndals Hardware Store and TheMaycomb Tribune office. The jail was Maycombs only conversation piece: its detractorssaid it looked like a Victorian privy; its supporters said it gave the town a good solidrespectable look, and no stranger would ever suspect that it was full of niggers.

As we walked up the sidewalk, we saw a solitary light burning in the distance. Thatsfunny, said Jem, jail doesnt have an outside light.

Looks like its over the door, said Dill.

A long extension cord ran between the bars of a second-floor window and down theside of the building. In the light from its bare bulb, Atticus was sitting propped againstthe front door. He was sitting in one of his office chairs, and he was reading, oblivious ofthe nightbugs dancing over his head.

I made to run, but Jem caught me. Dont go to him, he said, he might not like it. Hesall right, lets go home. I just wanted to see where he was.

We were taking a short cut across the square when four dusty cars came in from theMeridian highway, moving slowly in a line. They went around the square, passed thebank building, and stopped in front of the jail.

Nobody got out. We saw Atticus look up from his newspaper. He closed it, folded itdeliberately, dropped it in his lap, and pushed his hat to the back of his head. Heseemed to be expecting them.

Come on, whispered Jem. We streaked across the square, across the street, untilwe were in the shelter of the Jitney Jungle door. Jem peeked up the sidewalk. We canget closer, he said. We ran to Tyndals Hardware doornear enough, at the same timediscreet.

In ones and twos, men got out of the cars. Shadows became substance as lightsrevealed solid shapes moving toward the jail door. Atticus remained where he was. Themen hid him from view.

He in there, Mr. Finch? a man said.

He is, we heard Atticus answer, and hes asleep. Dont wake him up.

In obedience to my father, there followed what I later realized was a sickeningly comicaspect of an unfunny situation: the men talked in near-whispers.

You know what we want, another man said. Get aside from the door, Mr. Finch.

You can turn around and go home again, Walter, Atticus said pleasantly. HeckTates around somewhere.

The hell he is, said another man. Hecks bunchs so deep in the woods they wontget out till mornin.

Indeed? Why so?

Called em off on a snipe hunt, was the succinct answer. Didnt you think athat, Mr.

Finch?

Thought about it, but didnt believe it. Well then, my fathers voice was still the same,that changes things, doesnt it?

It do, another deep voice said. Its owner was a shadow.

Do you really think so?

This was the second time I heard Atticus ask that question in two days, and it meantsomebodys man would get jumped. This was too good to miss. I broke away from Jemand ran as fast as I could to Atticus.

Jem shrieked and tried to catch me, but I had a lead on him and Dill. I pushed my waythrough dark smelly bodies and burst into the circle of light.

H-ey, Atticus!

I thought he would have a fine surprise, but his face killed my joy. A flash of plain fearwas going out of his eyes, but returned when Dill and Jem wriggled into the light.

There was a smell of stale whiskey and pigpen about, and when I glanced around Idiscovered that these men were strangers. They were not the people I saw last night.

Hot embarrassment shot through me: I had leaped triumphantly into a ring of people Ihad never seen before.

Atticus got up from his chair, but he was moving slowly, like an old man. He put thenewspaper down very carefully, adjusting its creases with lingering fingers. They weretrembling a little.

Go home, Jem, he said. Take Scout and Dill home.

We were accustomed to prompt, if not always cheerful acquiescence to Atticussinstructions, but from the way he stood Jem was not thinking of budging.

Go home, I said.

Jem shook his head. As Atticuss fists went to his hips, so did Jems, and as theyfaced each other I could see little resemblance between them: Jems soft brown hairand eyes, his oval face and snug-fitting ears were our mothers, contrasting oddly withAtticuss graying black hair and square-cut features, but they were somehow alike.

Mutual defiance made them alike.

Son, I said go home.

Jem shook his head.

Ill send him home, a burly man said, and grabbed Jem roughly by the collar. Heyanked Jem nearly off his feet.

Dont you touch him! I kicked the man swiftly. Barefooted, I was surprised to see himfall back in real pain. I intended to kick his shin, but aimed too high.

Thatll do, Scout. Atticus put his hand on my shoulder. Dont kick folks. No hesaid, as I was pleading justification.

Aint nobody gonna do Jem that way, I said.

All right, Mr. Finch, get em outa here, someone growled. You got fifteen seconds toget em outa here.

In the midst of this strange assembly, Atticus stood trying to make Jem mind him. Iaint going, was his steady answer to Atticuss threats, requests, and finally, PleaseJem, take them home.

I was getting a bit tired of that, but felt Jem had his own reasons for doing as he did, inview of his prospects once Atticus did get him home. I looked around the crowd. It was asummers night, but the men were dressed, most of them, in overalls and denim shirtsbuttoned up to the collars. I thought they must be cold-natured, as their sleeves wereunrolled and buttoned at the cuffs. Some wore hats pulled firmly down over their ears.

They were sullen-looking, sleepy-eyed men who seemed unused to late hours. I soughtonce more for a familiar face, and at the center of the semi-circle I found one.

Hey, Mr. Cunningham.

The man did not hear me, it seemed.

Hey, Mr. Cunningham. Hows your entailment gettin along?

Mr. Walter Cunninghams legal affairs were well known to me; Atticus had oncedescribed them at length. The big man blinked and hooked his thumbs in his overallstraps. He seemed uncomfortable; he cleared his throat and looked away. My friendlyoverture had fallen flat.

Mr. Cunningham wore no hat, and the top half of his forehead was white in contrast tohis sunscorched face, which led me to believe that he wore one most days. He shiftedhis feet, clad in heavy work shoes.

Dont you remember me, Mr. Cunningham? Im Jean Louise Finch. You brought ussome hickory nuts one time, remember? I began to sense the futility one feels whenunacknowledged by a chance acquaintance.

I go to school with Walter, I began again. Hes your boy, aint he? Aint he, sir?

Mr. Cunningham was moved to a faint nod. He did know me, after all.

Hes in my grade, I said, and he does right well. Hes a good boy, I added, a realnice boy. We brought him home for dinner one time. Maybe he told you about me, I beathim up one time but he was real nice about it. Tell him hey for me, wont you?

Atticus had said it was the polite thing to talk to people about what they wereinterested in, not about what you were interested in. Mr. Cunningham displayed nointerest in his son, so I tackled his entailment once more in a last-ditch effort to makehim feel at home.

Entailments are bad, I was advising him, when I slowly awoke to the fact that I wasaddressing the entire aggregation. The men were all looking at me, some had theirmouths half-open. Atticus had stopped poking at Jem: they were standing togetherbeside Dill. Their attention amounted to fascination. Atticuss mouth, even, was half-open, an attitude he had once described as uncouth. Our eyes met and he shut it.

Well, Atticus, I was just sayin to Mr. Cunningham that entailments are bad an allthat, but you said not to worry, it takes a long time sometimes that you alld ride it outtogether I was slowly drying up, wondering what idiocy I had committed. Entailmentsseemed all right enough for livingroom talk.

I began to feel sweat gathering at the edges of my hair; I could stand anything but abunch of people looking at me. They were quite still.

Whats the matter? I asked.

Atticus said nothing. I looked around and up at Mr. Cunningham, whose face wasequally impassive. Then he did a peculiar thing. He squatted down and took me by bothshoulders.

Ill tell him you said hey, little lady, he said.

Then he straightened up and waved a big paw. Lets clear out, he called. Lets getgoing, boys.

As they had come, in ones and twos the men shuffled back to their ramshackle cars.

Doors slammed, engines coughed, and they were gone.

I turned to Atticus, but Atticus had gone to the jail and was leaning against it with hisface to the wall. I went to him and pulled his sleeve. Can we go home now? Henodded, produced his handkerchief, gave his face a going-over and blew his noseviolently.

Mr. Finch?

A soft husky voice came from the darkness above: They gone?

Atticus stepped back and looked up. Theyve gone, he said. Get some sleep, Tom.

They wont bother you any more.

From a different direction, another voice cut crisply through the night: Youre damntootin they wont. Had you covered all the time, Atticus.

Mr. Underwood and a double-barreled shotgun were leaning out his window aboveThe Maycomb Tribune office.

It was long past my bedtime and I was growing quite tired; it seemed that Atticus andMr. Underwood would talk for the rest of the night, Mr. Underwood out the window andAtticus up at him. Finally Atticus returned, switched off the light above the jail door, andpicked up his chair.

Can I carry it for you, Mr. Finch? asked Dill. He had not said a word the whole time.

Why, thank you, son.

Walking toward the office, Dill and I fell into step behind Atticus and Jem. Dill wasencumbered by the chair, and his pace was slower. Atticus and Jem were well ahead ofus, and I assumed that Atticus was giving him hell for not going home, but I was wrong.

As they passed under a streetlight, Atticus reached out and massaged Jems hair, hisone gesture of affection.


Chapter 16

Jem heard me. He thrust his head around the connecting door. As he came to my bedAtticuss light flashed on. We stayed where we were until it went off; we heard him turnover, and we waited until he was still again.

Jem took me to his room and put me in bed beside him. Try to go to sleep, he said,Itll be all over after tomorrow, maybe.

We had come in quietly, so as not to wake Aunty. Atticus killed the engine in thedriveway and coasted to the carhouse; we went in the back door and to our roomswithout a word. I was very tired, and was drifting into sleep when the memory of Atticuscalmly folding his newspaper and pushing back his hat became Atticus standing in themiddle of an empty waiting street, pushing up his glasses. The full meaning of thenights events hit me and I began crying. Jem was awfully nice about it: for once hedidnt remind me that people nearly nine years old didnt do things like that.

Everybodys appetite was delicate this morning, except Jems: he ate his way throughthree eggs. Atticus watched in frank admiration; Aunt Alexandra sipped coffee andradiated waves of disapproval. Children who slipped out at night were a disgrace to thefamily. Atticus said he was right glad his disgraces had come along, but Aunty said,Nonsense, Mr. Underwood was there all the time.

You know, its a funny thing about Braxton, said Atticus. He despises Negroes,wont have one near him.

Local opinion held Mr. Underwood to be an intense, profane little man, whose father ina fey fit of humor christened Braxton Bragg, a name Mr. Underwood had done his bestto live down. Atticus said naming people after Confederate generals made slow steadydrinkers.

Calpurnia was serving Aunt Alexandra more coffee, and she shook her head at what Ithought was a pleading winning look. Youre still too little, she said. Ill tell you whenyou aint. I said it might help my stomach. All right, she said, and got a cup from thesideboard. She poured one tablespoonful of coffee into it and filled the cup to the brimwith milk. I thanked her by sticking out my tongue at it, and looked up to catch Auntyswarning frown. But she was frowning at Atticus.

She waited until Calpurnia was in the kitchen, then she said, Dont talk like that infront of them.

Talk like what in front of whom? he asked.

Like that in front of Calpurnia. You said Braxton Underwood despises Negroes right infront of her.

Well, Im sure Cal knows it. Everybody in Maycomb knows it.

I was beginning to notice a subtle change in my father these days, that came out whenhe talked with Aunt Alexandra. It was a quiet digging in, never outright irritation. Therewas a faint starchiness in his voice when he said, Anything fit to say at the tables fit tosay in front of Calpurnia. She knows what she means to this family.

I dont think its a good habit, Atticus. It encourages them. You know how they talkamong themselves. Every thing that happens in this towns out to the Quarters beforesundown.

My father put down his knife. I dont know of any law that says they cant talk. Maybeif we didnt give them so much to talk about theyd be quiet. Why dont you drink yourcoffee, Scout?

I was playing in it with the spoon. I thought Mr. Cunningham was a friend of ours. Youtold me a long time ago he was.

He still is.

But last night he wanted to hurt you.

Atticus placed his fork beside his knife and pushed his plate aside. Mr. Cunninghamsbasically a good man, he said, he just has his blind spots along with the rest of us.

Jem spoke. Dont call that a blind spot. Heda killed you last night when he first wentthere.

He might have hurt me a little, Atticus conceded, but son, youll understand folks alittle better when youre older. A mobs always made up of people, no matter what. Mr.

Cunningham was part of a mob last night, but he was still a man. Every mob in everylittle Southern town is always made up of people you knowdoesnt say much for them,does it?

Ill say not, said Jem.

So it took an eight-year-old child to bring em to their senses, didnt it? said Atticus.

That proves somethingthat a gang of wild animals can be stopped, simply becausetheyre still human. Hmp, maybe we need a police force of children you children lastnight made Walter Cunningham stand in my shoes for a minute. That was enough.

Well, I hoped Jem would understand folks a little better when he was older; I wouldnt.

First day Walter comes back to schoolll be his last, I affirmed.

You will not touch him, Atticus said flatly. I dont want either of you bearing a grudgeabout this thing, no matter what happens.

You see, dont you, said Aunt Alexandra, what comes of things like this. Dont say Ihavent told you.

Atticus said hed never say that, pushed out his chair and got up. Theres a dayahead, so excuse me. Jem, I dont want you and Scout downtown today, please.

As Atticus departed, Dill came bounding down the hall into the diningroom. Its allover town this morning, he announced, all about how we held off a hundred folks withour bare hands Aunt Alexandra stared him to silence. It was not a hundred folks,

she said, and nobody held anybody off. It was just a nest of those Cunninghams, drunkand disorderly.

Aw, Aunty, thats just Dills way, said Jem. He signaled us to follow him.

You all stay in the yard today, she said, as we made our way to the front porch.

It was like Saturday. People from the south end of the county passed our house in aleisurely but steady stream.

Mr. Dolphus Raymond lurched by on his thoroughbred. Dont see how he stays in thesaddle, murmured Jem. How cn you stand to get drunk fore eight in the morning?

A wagonload of ladies rattled past us. They wore cotton sunbonnets and dresses withlong sleeves. A bearded man in a wool hat drove them. Yonders some Mennonites,

Jem said to Dill. They dont have buttons. They lived deep in the woods, did most oftheir trading across the river, and rarely came to Maycomb. Dill was interested. Theyveall got blue eyes, Jem explained, and the men cant shave after they marry. Theirwives like for em to tickle em with their beards.

Mr. X Billups rode by on a mule and waved to us. Hes a funny man, said Jem. Xshis name, not his initial. He was in court one time and they asked him his name. He saidX Billups. Clerk asked him to spell it and he said X. Asked him again and he said X.

They kept at it till he wrote X on a sheet of paper and held it up for everybody to see.

They asked him where he got his name and he said thats the way his folks signed himup when he was born.

As the county went by us, Jem gave Dill the histories and general attitudes of themore prominent figures: Mr. Tensaw Jones voted the straight Prohibition ticket; MissEmily Davis dipped snuff in private; Mr. Byron Waller could play the violin; Mr. JakeSlade was cutting his third set of teeth.

A wagonload of unusually stern-faced citizens appeared. When they pointed to MissMaudie Atkinsons yard, ablaze with summer flowers, Miss Maudie herself came out onthe porch. There was an odd thing about Miss Maudieon her porch she was too faraway for us to see her features clearly, but we could always catch her mood by the wayshe stood. She was now standing arms akimbo, her shoulders drooping a little, her headcocked to one side, her glasses winking in the sunlight. We knew she wore a grin of theuttermost wickedness.

The driver of the wagon slowed down his mules, and a shrill-voiced woman called out:

He that cometh in vanity departeth in darkness!

Miss Maudie answered: A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance!

I guess that the foot-washers thought that the Devil was quoting Scripture for his ownpurposes, as the driver speeded his mules. Why they objected to Miss Maudies yardwas a mystery, heightened in my mind because for someone who spent all the daylighthours outdoors, Miss Maudies command of Scripture was formidable.

You goin to court this morning? asked Jem. We had strolled over.

I am not, she said. I have no business with the court this morning.

Arent you goin down to watch? asked Dill.

I am not. ts morbid, watching a poor devil on trial for his life. Look at all those folks,its like a Roman carnival.

They hafta try him in public, Miss Maudie, I said. Wouldnt be right if they didnt.

Im quite aware of that, she said. Just because its public, I dont have to go, do I?

Miss Stephanie Crawford came by. She wore a hat and gloves. Um, um, um, shesaid. Look at all those folksyoud think William Jennings Bryan was speakin.

And where are you going, Stephanie? inquired Miss Maudie.

To the Jitney Jungle.

Miss Maudie said shed never seen Miss Stephanie go to the Jitney Jungle in a hat inher life.

Well, said Miss Stephanie, I thought I might just look in at the courthouse, to seewhat Atticuss up to.

Better be careful he doesnt hand you a subpoena.

We asked Miss Maudie to elucidate: she said Miss Stephanie seemed to know somuch about the case she might as well be called on to testify.

We held off until noon, when Atticus came home to dinner and said theyd spent themorning picking the jury. After dinner, we stopped by for Dill and went to town.

It was a gala occasion. There was no room at the public hitching rail for anotheranimal, mules and wagons were parked under every available tree. The courthousesquare was covered with picnic parties sitting on newspapers, washing down biscuit andsyrup with warm milk from fruit jars. Some people were gnawing on cold chicken andcold fried pork chops. The more affluent chased their food with drugstore Coca-Cola inbulb-shaped soda glasses. Greasy-faced children popped-the-whip through the crowd,and babies lunched at their mothers breasts.

In a far corner of the square, the Negroes sat quietly in the sun, dining on sardines,crackers, and the more vivid flavors of Nehi Cola. Mr. Dolphus Raymond sat with them.

Jem, said Dill, hes drinkin out of a sack.

Mr. Dolphus Raymond seemed to be so doing: two yellow drugstore straws ran fromhis mouth to the depths of a brown paper bag.

Aint ever seen anybody do that, murmured Dill.

How does he keep whats in it in it?

Jem giggled. Hes got a Co-Cola bottle full of whiskey in there. Thats sos not toupset the ladies. Youll see him sip it all afternoon, hell step out for a while and fill itback up.

Whys he sittin with the colored folks?

Always does. He likes em bettern he likes us, I reckon. Lives by himself way downnear the county line. Hes got a colored woman and all sorts of mixed chillun. Show yousome of em if we see em.

He doesnt look like trash, said Dill.

Hes not, he owns all one side of the riverbank down there, and hes from a real oldfamily to boot.

Then why does he do like that?

Thats just his way, said Jem. They say he never got over his weddin. He wassupposed to marry one of thethe Spencer ladies, I think. They were gonna have ahuge weddin, but they didntafter the rehearsal the bride went upstairs and blew herhead off. Shotgun. She pulled the trigger with her toes.

Did they ever know why?

No, said Jem, nobody ever knew quite why but Mr. Dolphus. They said it wasbecause she found out about his colored woman, he reckoned he could keep her andget married too. Hes been sorta drunk ever since. You know, though, hes real good tothose chillun

Jem, I asked, whats a mixed child?

Half white, half colored. Youve seen em, Scout. You know that red-kinky-headedone that delivers for the drugstore. Hes half white. Theyre real sad.

Sad, how come?

They dont belong anywhere. Colored folks wont have em because theyre halfwhite; white folks wont have em cause theyre colored, so theyre just in-betweens,dont belong anywhere. But Mr. Dolphus, now, they say hes shipped two of his up north.

They dont mind em up north. Yonders one of em.

A small boy clutching a Negro womans hand walked toward us. He looked all Negroto me: he was rich chocolate with flaring nostrils and beautiful teeth. Sometimes hewould skip happily, and the Negro woman tugged his hand to make him stop.

Jem waited until they passed us. Thats one of the little ones, he said.

How can you tell? asked Dill. He looked black to me.

You cant sometimes, not unless you know who they are. But hes half Raymond, allright.

But how can you tell? I asked.

I told you, Scout, you just hafta know who they are.

Well how do you know we aint Negroes?

Uncle Jack Finch says we really dont know. He says as far as he can trace back theFinches we aint, but for all he knows we mighta come straight out of Ethiopia durin theOld Testament.

Well if we came out durin the Old Testament its too long ago to matter.

Thats what I thought, said Jem, but around here once you have a drop of Negroblood, that makes you all black. Hey, look

Some invisible signal had made the lunchers on the square rise and scatter bits ofnewspaper, cellophane, and wrapping paper. Children came to mothers, babies werecradled on hips as men in sweat-stained hats collected their families and herded themthrough the courthouse doors. In the far corner of the square the Negroes and Mr.

Dolphus Raymond stood up and dusted their breeches. There were few women andchildren among them, which seemed to dispel the holiday mood. They waited patientlyat the doors behind the white families.

Lets go in, said Dill.

Naw, we better wait till they get in, Atticus might not like it if he sees us, said Jem.

The Maycomb County courthouse was faintly reminiscent of Arlington in one respect:

the concrete pillars supporting its south roof were too heavy for their light burden. Thepillars were all that remained standing when the original courthouse burned in 1856.

Another courthouse was built around them. It is better to say, built in spite of them. Butfor the south porch, the Maycomb County courthouse was early Victorian, presenting anunoffensive vista when seen from the north. From the other side, however, Greek revivalcolumns clashed with a big nineteenth-century clock tower housing a rusty unreliableinstrument, a view indicating a people determined to preserve every physical scrap ofthe past.

To reach the courtroom, on the second floor, one passed sundry sunless countycubbyholes: the tax assessor, the tax collector, the county clerk, the county solicitor, thecircuit clerk, the judge of probate lived in cool dim hutches that smelled of decayingrecord books mingled with old damp cement and stale urine. It was necessary to turn onthe lights in the daytime; there was always a film of dust on the rough floorboards. Theinhabitants of these offices were creatures of their environment: little gray-faced men,they seemed untouched by wind or sun.

We knew there was a crowd, but we had not bargained for the multitudes in the first-floor hallway. I got separated from Jem and Dill, but made my way toward the wall bythe stairwell, knowing Jem would come for me eventually. I found myself in the middle ofthe Idlers Club and made myself as unobtrusive as possible. This was a group of white-shirted, khaki-trousered, suspendered old men who had spent their lives doing nothingand passed their twilight days doing same on pine benches under the live oaks on thesquare. Attentive critics of courthouse business, Atticus said they knew as much law asthe Chief Justice, from long years of observation. Normally, they were the courts onlyspectators, and today they seemed resentful of the interruption of their comfortableroutine. When they spoke, their voices sounded casually important. The conversationwas about my father.

thinks he knows what hes doing, one said.

Oh-h now, I wouldnt say that, said another. Atticus Finchs a deep reader, a mightydeep reader.

He reads all right, thats all he does. The club snickered.

Lemme tell you somethin now, Billy, a third said, you know the court appointed himto defend this nigger.

Yeah, but Atticus aims to defend him. Thats what I dont like about it.

This was news, news that put a different light on things: Atticus had to, whether hewanted to or not. I thought it odd that he hadnt said anything to us about itwe couldhave used it many times in defending him and ourselves. He had to, thats why he wasdoing it, equaled fewer fights and less fussing. But did that explain the towns attitude?

The court appointed Atticus to defend him. Atticus aimed to defend him. Thats whatthey didnt like about it. It was confusing.

The Negroes, having waited for the white people to go upstairs, began to come in.

Whoa now, just a minute, said a club member, holding up his walking stick. Just dontstart up them there stairs yet awhile.

The club began its stiff-jointed climb and ran into Dill and Jem on their way downlooking for me. They squeezed past and Jem called, Scout, come on, there aint a seatleft. Well hafta stand up.

Looka there, now. he said irritably, as the black people surged upstairs. The old menahead of them would take most of the standing room. We were out of luck and it was myfault, Jem informed me. We stood miserably by the wall.

Cant you all get in?

Reverend Sykes was looking down at us, black hat in hand.

Hey, Reverend, said Jem. Naw, Scout here messed us up.

Well, lets see what we can do.

Reverend Sykes edged his way upstairs. In a few moments he was back. Theres nota seat downstairs. Do you all reckon itll be all right if you all came to the balcony withme?

Gosh yes, said Jem. Happily, we sped ahead of Reverend Sykes to the courtroomfloor. There, we went up a covered staircase and waited at the door. Reverend Sykescame puffing behind us, and steered us gently through the black people in the balcony.

Four Negroes rose and gave us their front-row seats.

The Colored balcony ran along three walls of the courtroom like a second-storyveranda, and from it we could see everything.

The jury sat to the left, under long windows. Sunburned, lanky, they seemed to be allfarmers, but this was natural: townfolk rarely sat on juries, they were either struck orexcused. One or two of the jury looked vaguely like dressed-up Cunninghams. At thisstage they sat straight and alert.

The circuit solicitor and another man, Atticus and Tom Robinson sat at tables withtheir backs to us. There was a brown book and some yellow tablets on the solicitorstable; Atticuss was bare. Just inside the railing that divided the spectators from thecourt, the witnesses sat on cowhide-bottomed chairs. Their backs were to us.

Judge Taylor was on the bench, looking like a sleepy old shark, his pilot fish writingrapidly below in front of him. Judge Taylor looked like most judges I had ever seen:

amiable, white-haired, slightly ruddy-faced, he was a man who ran his court with analarming informalityhe sometimes propped his feet up, he often cleaned his fingernailswith his pocket knife. In long equity hearings, especially after dinner, he gave theimpression of dozing, an impression dispelled forever when a lawyer once deliberatelypushed a pile of books to the floor in a desperate effort to wake him up. Without openinghis eyes, Judge Taylor murmured, Mr. Whitley, do that again and itll cost you onehundred dollars.

He was a man learned in the law, and although he seemed to take his job casually, inreality he kept a firm grip on any proceedings that came before him. Only once wasJudge Taylor ever seen at a dead standstill in open court, and the Cunninghamsstopped him. Old Sarum, their stamping grounds, was populated by two familiesseparate and apart in the beginning, but unfortunately bearing the same name. TheCunninghams married the Coninghams until the spelling of the names was academicacademic until a Cunningham disputed a Coningham over land titles and took to thelaw. During a controversy of this character, Jeems Cunningham testified that his motherspelled it Cunningham on deeds and things, but she was really a Coningham, she wasan uncertain speller, a seldom reader, and was given to looking far away sometimeswhen she sat on the front gallery in the evening. After nine hours of listening to theeccentricities of Old Sarums inhabitants, Judge Taylor threw the case out of court.

When asked upon what grounds, Judge Taylor said, Champertous connivance, anddeclared he hoped to God the litigants were satisfied by each having had their publicsay. They were. That was all they had wanted in the first place.

Judge Taylor had one interesting habit. He permitted smoking in his courtroom but didnot himself indulge: sometimes, if one was lucky, one had the privilege of watching himput a long dry cigar into his mouth and munch it slowly up. Bit by bit the dead cigarwould disappear, to reappear some hours later as a flat slick mess, its essenceextracted and mingling with Judge Taylors digestive juices. I once asked Atticus howMrs. Taylor stood to kiss him, but Atticus said they didnt kiss much.

The witness stand was to the right of Judge Taylor, and when we got to our seats Mr.

Heck Tate was already on it.


Chapter 17

Jem, I said, are those the Ewells sittin down yonder?

Hush, said Jem, Mr. Heck Tates testifyin.

Mr. Tate had dressed for the occasion. He wore an ordinary business suit, whichmade him look somehow like every other man: gone were his high boots, lumber jacket,and bullet-studded belt. From that moment he ceased to terrify me. He was sittingforward in the witness chair, his hands clasped between his knees, listening attentivelyto the circuit solicitor.

The solicitor, a Mr. Gilmer, was not well known to us. He was from Abbottsville; wesaw him only when court convened, and that rarely, for court was of no special interestto Jem and me. A balding, smooth-faced man, he could have been anywhere betweenforty and sixty. Although his back was to us, we knew he had a slight cast in one of hiseyes which he used to his advantage: he seemed to be looking at a person when hewas actually doing nothing of the kind, thus he was hell on juries and witnesses. Thejury, thinking themselves under close scrutiny, paid attention; so did the witnesses,thinking likewise.

in your own words, Mr. Tate, Mr. Gilmer was saying.

Well, said Mr. Tate, touching his glasses and speaking to his knees, I was called

Could you say it to the jury, Mr. Tate? Thank you. Who called you?

Mr. Tate said, I was fetched by Bobby Mr. Bob Ewell yonder, one night

What night, sir?

Mr. Tate said, It was the night of November twenty-first. I was just leaving my office togo home when BMr. Ewell came in, very excited he was, and said get out to his housequick, some niggerd raped his girl.

Did you go?

Certainly. Got in the car and went out as fast as I could.

And what did you find?

Found her lying on the floor in the middle of the front room, one on the right as you goin. She was pretty well beat up, but I heaved her to her feet and she washed her face ina bucket in the corner and said she was all right. I asked her who hurt her and she saidit was Tom Robinson

Judge Taylor, who had been concentrating on his fingernails, looked up as if he wereexpecting an objection, but Atticus was quiet.

asked her if he beat her like that, she said yes he had. Asked her if he tookadvantage of her and she said yes he did. So I went down to Robinsons house andbrought him back. She identified him as the one, so I took him in. Thats all there was toit.

Thank you, said Mr. Gilmer.

Judge Taylor said, Any questions, Atticus?

Yes, said my father. He was sitting behind his table; his chair was skewed to oneside, his legs were crossed and one arm was resting on the back of his chair.

Did you call a doctor, Sheriff? Did anybody call a doctor? asked Atticus.

No sir, said Mr. Tate.

Didnt call a doctor?

No sir, repeated Mr. Tate.

Why not? There was an edge to Atticuss voice.

Well I can tell you why I didnt. It wasnt necessary, Mr. Finch. She was mightybanged up. Something sho happened, it was obvious.

But you didnt call a doctor? While you were there did anyone send for one, fetch one,carry her to one?

No sir

Judge Taylor broke in. Hes answered the question three times, Atticus. He didnt calla doctor.

Atticus said, I just wanted to make sure, Judge, and the judge smiled.

Jems hand, which was resting on the balcony rail, tightened around it. He drew in hisbreath suddenly. Glancing below, I saw no corresponding reaction, and wondered if Jemwas trying to be dramatic. Dill was watching peacefully, and so was Reverend Sykesbeside him.

What is it? I whispered, and got a terse, Sh-h!

Sheriff, Atticus was saying, you say she was mighty banged up. In what way?

Well

Just describe her injuries, Heck.

Well, she was beaten around the head. There was already bruises comin on herarms, and it happened about thirty minutes before

How do you know?

Mr. Tate grinned. Sorry, thats what they said. Anyway, she was pretty bruised upwhen I got there, and she had a black eye comin.

Which eye?

Mr. Tate blinked and ran his hands through his hair. Lets see, he said softly, then helooked at Atticus as if he considered the question childish. Cant you remember?

Atticus asked.

Mr. Tate pointed to an invisible person five inches in front of him and said, Her left.

Wait a minute, Sheriff, said Atticus. Was it her left facing you or her left looking thesame way you were?

Mr. Tate said, Oh yes, thatd make it her right. It was her right eye, Mr. Finch. Iremember now, she was bunged up on that side of her face

Mr. Tate blinked again, as if something had suddenly been made plain to him. Thenhe turned his head and looked around at Tom Robinson. As if by instinct, Tom Robinsonraised his head.

Something had been made plain to Atticus also, and it brought him to his feet. Sheriff,please repeat what you said.

It was her right eye, I said.

No Atticus walked to the court reporters desk and bent down to the furiouslyscribbling hand. It stopped, flipped back the shorthand pad, and the court reporter said,Mr. Finch. I remember now she was bunged up on that side of the face.

Atticus looked up at Mr. Tate. Which side again, Heck?

The right side, Mr. Finch, but she had more bruisesyou wanta hear about em?

Atticus seemed to be bordering on another question, but he thought better of it andsaid, Yes, what were her other injuries? As Mr. Tate answered, Atticus turned andlooked at Tom Robinson as if to say this was something they hadnt bargained for.

her arms were bruised, and she showed me her neck. There were definite fingermarks on her gullet

All around her throat? At the back of her neck?

Id say they were all around, Mr. Finch.

You would?

Yes sir, she had a small throat, anybody coulda reached around it with

Just answer the question yes or no, please, Sheriff, said Atticus dryly, and Mr. Tatefell silent.

Atticus sat down and nodded to the circuit solicitor, who shook his head at the judge,who nodded to Mr. Tate, who rose stiffly and stepped down from the witness stand.

Below us, heads turned, feet scraped the floor, babies were shifted to shoulders, anda few children scampered out of the courtroom. The Negroes behind us whispered softlyamong themselves; Dill was asking Reverend Sykes what it was all about, but ReverendSykes said he didnt know. So far, things were utterly dull: nobody had thundered, therewere no arguments between opposing counsel, there was no drama; a gravedisappointment to all present, it seemed. Atticus was proceeding amiably, as if he wereinvolved in a title dispute. With his infinite capacity for calming turbulent seas, he couldmake a rape case as dry as a sermon. Gone was the terror in my mind of stale whiskeyand barnyard smells, of sleepy-eyed sullen men, of a husky voice calling in the night,Mr. Finch? They gone? Our nightmare had gone with daylight, everything would comeout all right.

All the spectators were as relaxed as Judge Taylor, except Jem. His mouth wastwisted into a purposeful half-grin, and his eyes happy about, and he said somethingabout corroborating evidence, which made me sure he was showing off.

Robert E. Lee Ewell!

In answer to the clerks booming voice, a little bantam cock of a man rose and struttedto the stand, the back of his neck reddening at the sound of his name. When he turnedaround to take the oath, we saw that his face was as red as his neck. We also saw noresemblance to his namesake. A shock of wispy new-washed hair stood up from hisforehead; his nose was thin, pointed, and shiny; he had no chin to speak ofit seemedto be part of his crepey neck.

so help me God, he crowed.

Every town the size of Maycomb had families like the Ewells. No economicfluctuations changed their statuspeople like the Ewells lived as guests of the county inprosperity as well as in the depths of a depression. No truant officers could keep theirnumerous offspring in school; no public health officer could free them from congenitaldefects, various worms, and the diseases indigenous to filthy surroundings.

Maycombs Ewells lived behind the town garbage dump in what was once a Negrocabin. The cabins plank walls were supplemented with sheets of corrugated iron, itsroof shingled with tin cans hammered flat, so only its general shape suggested itsoriginal design: square, with four tiny rooms opening onto a shotgun hall, the cabinrested uneasily upon four irregular lumps of limestone. Its windows were merely openspaces in the walls, which in the summertime were covered with greasy strips ofcheesecloth to keep out the varmints that feasted on Maycombs refuse.

The varmints had a lean time of it, for the Ewells gave the dump a thorough gleaningevery day, and the fruits of their industry (those that were not eaten) made the plot ofground around the cabin look like the playhouse of an insane child: what passed for afence was bits of tree-limbs, broomsticks and tool shafts, all tipped with rusty hammer-heads, snaggle-toothed rake heads, shovels, axes and grubbing hoes, held on withpieces of barbed wire. Enclosed by this barricade was a dirty yard containing theremains of a Model-T Ford (on blocks), a discarded dentists chair, an ancient icebox,plus lesser items: old shoes, worn-out table radios, picture frames, and fruit jars, underwhich scrawny orange chickens pecked hopefully.

One corner of the yard, though, bewildered Maycomb. Against the fence, in a line,were six chipped-enamel slop jars holding brilliant red geraniums, cared for as tenderlyas if they belonged to Miss Maudie Atkinson, had Miss Maudie deigned to permit ageranium on her premises. People said they were Mayella Ewells.

Nobody was quite sure how many children were on the place. Some people said six,others said nine; there were always several dirty-faced ones at the windows whenanyone passed by. Nobody had occasion to pass by except at Christmas, when thechurches delivered baskets, and when the mayor of Maycomb asked us to please helpthe garbage collector by dumping our own trees and trash.

Atticus took us with him last Christmas when he complied with the mayors request. Adirt road ran from the highway past the dump, down to a small Negro settlement somefive hundred yards beyond the Ewells. It was necessary either to back out to thehighway or go the full length of the road and turn around; most people turned around inthe Negroes front yards. In the frosty December dusk, their cabins looked neat andsnug with pale blue smoke rising from the chimneys and doorways glowing amber fromthe fires inside. There were delicious smells about: chicken, bacon frying crisp as thetwilight air. Jem and I detected squirrel cooking, but it took an old countryman likeAtticus to identify possum and rabbit, aromas that vanished when we rode back past theEwell residence.

All the little man on the witness stand had that made him any better than his nearestneighbors was, that if scrubbed with lye soap in very hot water, his skin was white.

Mr. Robert Ewell? asked Mr. Gilmer.

Thats mname, capn, said the witness.

Mr. Gilmers back stiffened a little, and I felt sorry for him. Perhaps Id better explainsomething now. Ive heard that lawyers children, on seeing their parents in court in theheat of argument, get the wrong idea: they think opposing counsel to be the personalenemies of their parents, they suffer agonies, and are surprised to see them often goout arm-in-arm with their tormenters during the first recess. This was not true of Jemand me. We acquired no traumas from watching our father win or lose. Im sorry that Icant provide any drama in this respect; if I did, it would not be true. We could tell,however, when debate became more acrimonious than professional, but this was fromwatching lawyers other than our father. I never heard Atticus raise his voice in my life,except to a deaf witness. Mr. Gilmer was doing his job, as Atticus was doing his.

Besides, Mr. Ewell was Mr. Gilmers witness, and he had no business being rude to himof all people.

Are you the father of Mayella Ewell? was the next question.

Well, if I aint I cant do nothing about it now, her mas dead, was the answer.

Judge Taylor stirred. He turned slowly in his swivel chair and looked benignly at thewitness. Are you the father of Mayella Ewell? he asked, in a way that made thelaughter below us stop suddenly.

Yes sir, Mr. Ewell said meekly.

Judge Taylor went on in tones of good will: This the first time youve ever been incourt? I dont recall ever seeing you here. At the witnesss affirmative nod he continued,Well, lets get something straight. There will be no more audibly obscene speculationson any subject from anybody in this courtroom as long as Im sitting here. Do youunderstand?

Mr. Ewell nodded, but I dont think he did. Judge Taylor sighed and said, All right, Mr.

Gilmer?

Thank you, sir. Mr. Ewell, would you tell us in your own words what happened on theevening of November twenty-first, please?

Jem grinned and pushed his hair back. Just-in-your-own words was Mr. Gilmerstrademark. We often wondered who elses words Mr. Gilmer was afraid his witnessmight employ.

Well, the night of November twenty-one I was comin in from the woods with a loadokindlin and just as I got to the fence I heard Mayella screamin like a stuck hog insidethe house

Here Judge Taylor glanced sharply at the witness and must have decided hisspeculations devoid of evil intent, for he subsided sleepily.

What time was it, Mr. Ewell?

Just fore sundown. Well, I was sayin Mayella was screamin fit to beat Jesus

another glance from the bench silenced Mr. Ewell.

Yes? She was screaming? said Mr. Gilmer.

Mr. Ewell looked confusedly at the judge. Well, Mayella was raisin this holy racket soI dropped mload and run as fast as I could but I run into th fence, but when I gotdistangled I run up to th window and I seen Mr. Ewells face grew scarlet. He stoodup and pointed his finger at Tom Robinson. I seen that black nigger yonder ruttin onmy Mayella!

So serene was Judge Taylors court, that he had few occasions to use his gavel, buthe hammered fully five minutes. Atticus was on his feet at the bench saying somethingto him, Mr. Heck Tate as first officer of the county stood in the middle aisle quelling thepacked courtroom. Behind us, there was an angry muffled groan from the coloredpeople.

Reverend Sykes leaned across Dill and me, pulling at Jems elbow. Mr. Jem, hesaid, you better take Miss Jean Louise home. Mr. Jem, you hear me?

Jem turned his head. Scout, go home. Dill, younScout go home.

You gotta make me first, I said, remembering Atticuss blessed dictum.

Jem scowled furiously at me, then said to Reverend Sykes, I think its okay,Reverend, she doesnt understand it.

I was mortally offended. I most certainly do, I cn understand anything you can.

Aw hush. She doesnt understand it, Reverend, she aint nine yet.

Reverend Sykess black eyes were anxious. Mr. Finch know you all are here? Thisaint fit for Miss Jean Louise or you boys either.

Jem shook his head. He cant see us this far away. Its all right, Reverend.

I knew Jem would win, because I knew nothing could make him leave now. Dill and Iwere safe, for a while: Atticus could see us from where he was, if he looked.

As Judge Taylor banged his gavel, Mr. Ewell was sitting smugly in the witness chair,surveying his handiwork. With one phrase he had turned happy picknickers into a sulky,tense, murmuring crowd, being slowly hypnotized by gavel taps lessening in intensityuntil the only sound in the courtroom was a dim pink-pink-pink: the judge might havebeen rapping the bench with a pencil.

In possession of his court once more, Judge Taylor leaned back in his chair. Helooked suddenly weary; his age was showing, and I thought about what Atticus hadsaidhe and Mrs. Taylor didnt kiss muchhe must have been nearly seventy.

There has been a request, Judge Taylor said, that this courtroom be cleared ofspectators, or at least of women and children, a request that will be denied for the timebeing. People generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for, and theyhave the right to subject their children to it, but I can assure you of one thing: you willreceive what you see and hear in silence or you will leave this courtroom, but you wontleave it until the whole boiling of you come before me on contempt charges. Mr. Ewell,you will keep your testimony within the confines of Christian English usage, if that ispossible. Proceed, Mr. Gilmer.

Mr. Ewell reminded me of a deaf-mute. I was sure he had never heard the wordsJudge Taylor directed at himhis mouth struggled silently with thembut their importregistered on his face. Smugness faded from it, replaced by a dogged earnestness thatfooled Judge Taylor not at all: as long as Mr. Ewell was on the stand, the judge kept hiseyes on him, as if daring him to make a false move.

Mr. Gilmer and Atticus exchanged glances. Atticus was sitting down again, his fistrested on his cheek and we could not see his face. Mr. Gilmer looked rather desperate.

A question from Judge Taylor made him relax: Mr. Ewell, did you see the defendanthaving sexual intercourse with your daughter?

Yes, I did.

The spectators were quiet, but the defendant said something. Atticus whispered tohim, and Tom Robinson was silent.

You say you were at the window? asked Mr. Gilmer.

Yes sir.

How far is it from the ground?

bout three foot.

Did you have a clear view of the room?

Yes sir.

How did the room look?

Well, it was all slung about, like there was a fight.

What did you do when you saw the defendant?

Well, I run around the house to get in, but he run out the front door just ahead of me. Isawed who he was, all right. I was too distracted about Mayella to run afterim. I run inthe house and she was lyin on the floor squallin

Then what did you do?

Why, I run for Tate quick as I could. I knowed who it was, all right, lived down yonderin that nigger-nest, passed the house every day. Jedge, Ive asked this county for fifteenyears to clean out that nest down yonder, theyre dangerous to live around sidesdevaluin my property

Thank you, Mr. Ewell, said Mr. Gilmer hurriedly.

The witness made a hasty descent from the stand and ran smack into Atticus, whohad risen to question him. Judge Taylor permitted the court to laugh.

Just a minute, sir, said Atticus genially. Could I ask you a question or two?

Mr. Ewell backed up into the witness chair, settled himself, and regarded Atticus withhaughty suspicion, an expression common to Maycomb County witnesses whenconfronted by opposing counsel.

Mr. Ewell, Atticus began, folks were doing a lot of running that night. Lets see, yousay you ran to the house, you ran to the window, you ran inside, you ran to Mayella, youran for Mr. Tate. Did you, during all this running, run for a doctor?

Wadnt no need to. I seen what happened.

But theres one thing I dont understand, said Atticus. Werent you concerned withMayellas condition?

I most positively was, said Mr. Ewell. I seen who done it.

No, I mean her physical condition. Did you not think the nature of her injurieswarranted immediate medical attention?

What?

Didnt you think she should have had a doctor, immediately?

The witness said he never thought of it, he had never called a doctor to any of hisn inhis life, and if he had it would have cost him five dollars. That all? he asked.

Not quite, said Atticus casually. Mr. Ewell, you heard the sheriffs testimony, didntyou?

Hows that?

You were in the courtroom when Mr. Heck Tate was on the stand, werent you? Youheard everything he said, didnt you?

Mr. Ewell considered the matter carefully, and seemed to decide that the question wassafe.

Yes, he said.

Do you agree with his description of Mayellas injuries?

Hows that?

Atticus looked around at Mr. Gilmer and smiled. Mr. Ewell seemed determined not togive the defense the time of day.

Mr. Tate testified that her right eye was blackened, that she was beaten around the

Oh yeah, said the witness. I hold with everything Tate said.

You do? asked Atticus mildly. I just want to make sure. He went to the courtreporter, said something, and the reporter entertained us for some minutes by readingMr. Tates testimony as if it were stock-market quotations: which eye her left oh yesthatd make it her right it was her right eye Mr. Finch I remember now she was bunged.

He flipped the page. Up on that side of the face Sheriff please repeat what you said itwas her right eye I said

Thank you, Bert, said Atticus. You heard it again, Mr. Ewell. Do you have anythingto add to it? Do you agree with the sheriff?

I holds with Tate. Her eye was blacked and she was mighty beat up.

The little man seemed to have forgotten his previous humiliation from the bench. Itwas becoming evident that he thought Atticus an easy match. He seemed to grow ruddyagain; his chest swelled, and once more he was a red little rooster. I thought hed bursthis shirt at Atticuss next question:

Mr. Ewell, can you read and write?

Mr. Gilmer interrupted. Objection, he said. Cant see what witnesss literacy has todo with the case, irrelevantnimmaterial.

Judge Taylor was about to speak but Atticus said, Judge, if youll allow the questionplus another one youll soon see.

All right, lets see, said Judge Taylor, but make sure we see, Atticus. Overruled.

Mr. Gilmer seemed as curious as the rest of us as to what bearing the state of Mr.

Ewells education had on the case.

Ill repeat the question, said Atticus. Can you read and write?

I most positively can.

Will you write your name and show us?

I most positively will. How do you think I sign my relief checks?

Mr. Ewell was endearing himself to his fellow citizens. The whispers and chucklesbelow us probably had to do with what a card he was.

I was becoming nervous. Atticus seemed to know what he was doingbut it seemedto me that hed gone frog-sticking without a light. Never, never, never, on cross-examination ask a witness a question you dont already know the answer to, was a tenetI absorbed with my baby-food. Do it, and youll often get an answer you dont want, ananswer that might wreck your case.

Atticus was reaching into the inside pocket of his coat. He drew out an envelope, thenreached into his vest pocket and unclipped his fountain pen. He moved leisurely, andhad turned so that he was in full view of the jury. He unscrewed the fountain-pen capand placed it gently on his table. He shook the pen a little, then handed it with theenvelope to the witness. Would you write your name for us? he asked. Clearly now,so the jury can see you do it.

Mr. Ewell wrote on the back of the envelope and looked up complacently to see JudgeTaylor staring at him as if he were some fragrant gardenia in full bloom on the witnessstand, to see Mr. Gilmer half-sitting, half-standing at his table. The jury was watchinghim, one man was leaning forward with his hands over the railing.

Whats so interestin? he asked.

Youre left-handed, Mr. Ewell, said Judge Taylor. Mr. Ewell turned angrily to thejudge and said he didnt see what his being left-handed had to do with it, that he was aChrist-fearing man and Atticus Finch was taking advantage of him. Tricking lawyers likeAtticus Finch took advantage of him all the time with their tricking ways. He had toldthem what happened, hed say it again and againwhich he did. Nothing Atticus askedhim after that shook his story, that hed looked through the window, then ran the niggeroff, then ran for the sheriff. Atticus finally dismissed him.

Mr. Gilmer asked him one more question. About your writing with your left hand, areyou ambidextrous, Mr. Ewell?

I most positively am not, I can use one hand good as the other. One hand good asthe other, he added, glaring at the defense table.

Jem seemed to be having a quiet fit. He was pounding the balcony rail softly, andonce he whispered, Weve got him.

I didnt think so: Atticus was trying to show, it seemed to me, that Mr. Ewell could havebeaten up Mayella. That much I could follow. If her right eye was blacked and she wasbeaten mostly on the right side of the face, it would tend to show that a left-handedperson did it. Sherlock Holmes and Jem Finch would agree. But Tom Robinson couldeasily be left-handed, too. Like Mr. Heck Tate, I imagined a person facing me, wentthrough a swift mental pantomime, and concluded that he might have held her with hisright hand and pounded her with his left. I looked down at him. His back was to us, but Icould see his broad shoulders and bull-thick neck. He could easily have done it. Ithought Jem was counting his chickens.


Chapter 18

But someone was booming again.

Mayella Violet Ewell!

A young girl walked to the witness stand. As she raised her hand and swore that theevidence she gave would be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so helpher God, she seemed somehow fragile-looking, but when she sat facing us in thewitness chair she became what she was, a thick-bodied girl accustomed to strenuouslabor.

In Maycomb County, it was easy to tell when someone bathed regularly, as opposedto yearly lavations: Mr. Ewell had a scalded look; as if an overnight soaking haddeprived him of protective layers of dirt, his skin appeared to be sensitive to theelements. Mayella looked as if she tried to keep clean, and I was reminded of the row ofred geraniums in the Ewell yard.

Mr. Gilmer asked Mayella to tell the jury in her own words what happened on theevening of November twenty-first of last year, just in her own words, please.

Mayella sat silently.

Where were you at dusk on that evening? began Mr. Gilmer patiently.

On the porch.

Which porch?

Aint but one, the front porch.

What were you doing on the porch?

Nothin.

Judge Taylor said, Just tell us what happened. You can do that, cant you?

Mayella stared at him and burst into tears. She covered her mouth with her hands andsobbed. Judge Taylor let her cry for a while, then he said, Thats enough now. Dont befraid of anybody here, as long as you tell the truth. All this is strange to you, I know, butyouve nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to fear. What are you scared of?

Mayella said something behind her hands. What was that? asked the judge.

Him, she sobbed, pointing at Atticus.

Mr. Finch?

She nodded vigorously, saying, Dont want him doin me like he done Papa, tryin tomake him out lefthanded

Judge Taylor scratched his thick white hair. It was plain that he had never beenconfronted with a problem of this kind. How old are you? he asked.

Nineteen-and-a-half, Mayella said.

Judge Taylor cleared his throat and tried unsuccessfully to speak in soothing tones.

Mr. Finch has no idea of scaring you, he growled, and if he did, Im here to stop him.

Thats one thing Im sitting up here for. Now youre a big girl, so you just sit up straightand tell thetell us what happened to you. You can do that, cant you?

I whispered to Jem, Has she got good sense?

Jem was squinting down at the witness stand. Cant tell yet, he said. Shes gotenough sense to get the judge sorry for her, but she might be justoh, I dont know.

Mollified, Mayella gave Atticus a final terrified glance and said to Mr. Gilmer, Well sir,I was on the porch andand he came along and, you see, there was this old chiffarobein the yard Papad brought in to chop up for kindlinPapa told me to do it while he wasoff in the woods but I wadnt feelin strong enough then, so he came by-

Who is he?

Mayella pointed to Tom Robinson. Ill have to ask you to be more specific, please,

said Mr. Gilmer. The reporter cant put down gestures very well.

Thatn yonder, she said. Robinson.

Then what happened?

I said come here, nigger, and bust up this chiffarobe for me, I gotta nickel for you. Hecoulda done it easy enough, he could. So he come in the yard an I went in the house toget him the nickel and I turned around an fore I knew it he was on me. Just run upbehind me, he did. He got me round the neck, cussin me an sayin dirtIfoughtnhollered, but he had me round the neck. He hit me agin an agin

Mr. Gilmer waited for Mayella to collect herself: she had twisted her handkerchief intoa sweaty rope; when she opened it to wipe her face it was a mass of creases from herhot hands. She waited for Mr. Gilmer to ask another question, but when he didnt, shesaid, -he chunked me on the floor an choked men took advantage of me.

Did you scream? asked Mr. Gilmer. Did you scream and fight back?

Reckon I did, hollered for all I was worth, kicked and hollered loud as I could.

Then what happened?

I dont remember too good, but next thing I knew Papa was in the room astandingover me hollerin who done it, who done it? Then I sorta fainted an the next thing I knewMr. Tate was pullin me up offa the floor and leadin me to the water bucket.

Apparently Mayellas recital had given her confidence, but it was not her fathers brashkind: there was something stealthy about hers, like a steady-eyed cat with a twitchy tail.

You say you fought him off as hard as you could? Fought him tooth and nail? askedMr. Gilmer.

I positively did, Mayella echoed her father.

You are positive that he took full advantage of you?

Mayellas face contorted, and I was afraid that she would cry again. Instead, she said,He done what he was after.

Mr. Gilmer called attention to the hot day by wiping his head with his hand. Thats allfor the time being, he said pleasantly, but you stay there. I expect big bad Mr. Finchhas some questions to ask you.

State will not prejudice the witness against counsel for the defense, murmured JudgeTaylor primly, at least not at this time.

Atticus got up grinning but instead of walking to the witness stand, he opened his coatand hooked his thumbs in his vest, then he walked slowly across the room to thewindows. He looked out, but didnt seem especially interested in what he saw, then heturned and strolled back to the witness stand. From long years of experience, I could tellhe was trying to come to a decision about something.

Miss Mayella, he said, smiling, I wont try to scare you for a while, not yet. Lets justget acquainted. How old are you?

Said I was nineteen, said it to the judge yonder. Mayella jerked her head resentfullyat the bench.

So you did, so you did, maam. Youll have to bear with me, Miss Mayella, Im gettingalong and cant remember as well as I used to. I might ask you things youve alreadysaid before, but youll give me an answer, wont you? Good.

I could see nothing in Mayellas expression to justify Atticuss assumption that he hadsecured her wholehearted cooperation. She was looking at him furiously.

Wont answer a word you say long as you keep on mockin me, she said.

Maam? asked Atticus, startled.

Longs you keep on makin fun ome.

Judge Taylor said, Mr. Finch is not making fun of you. Whats the matter with you?

Mayella looked from under lowered eyelids at Atticus, but she said to the judge:

Longs he keeps on callin me maam an sayin Miss Mayella. I dont hafta take hissass, I aint called upon to take it.

Atticus resumed his stroll to the windows and let Judge Taylor handle this one. JudgeTaylor was not the kind of figure that ever evoked pity, but I did feel a pang for him as hetried to explain. Thats just Mr. Finchs way, he told Mayella. Weve done business inthis court for years and years, and Mr. Finch is always courteous to everybody. Hes nottrying to mock you, hes trying to be polite. Thats just his way.

The judge leaned back. Atticus, lets get on with these proceedings, and let the recordshow that the witness has not been sassed, her views to the contrary.

I wondered if anybody had ever called her maam, or Miss Mayella in her life;probably not, as she took offense to routine courtesy. What on earth was her life like? Isoon found out.

You say youre nineteen, Atticus resumed. How many sisters and brothers haveyou? He walked from the windows back to the stand.

Sebm, she said, and I wondered if they were all like the specimen I had seen thefirst day I started to school.

You the eldest? The oldest?

Yes.

How long has your mother been dead?

Dont knowlong time.

Did you ever go to school?

Readnwrite good as Papa yonder.

Mayella sounded like a Mr. Jingle in a book I had been reading.

How long did you go to school?

Two yearthree yeardunno.

Slowly but surely I began to see the pattern of Atticuss questions: from questions thatMr. Gilmer did not deem sufficiently irrelevant or immaterial to object to, Atticus wasquietly building up before the jury a picture of the Ewells home life. The jury learned thefollowing things: their relief check was far from enough to feed the family, and there wasstrong suspicion that Papa drank it up anywayhe sometimes went off in the swamp fordays and came home sick; the weather was seldom cold enough to require shoes, butwhen it was, you could make dandy ones from strips of old tires; the family hauled itswater in buckets from a spring that ran out at one end of the dumpthey kept thesurrounding area clear of trashand it was everybody for himself as far as keepingclean went: if you wanted to wash you hauled your own water; the younger children hadperpetual colds and suffered from chronic ground-itch; there was a lady who camearound sometimes and asked Mayella why she didnt stay in schoolshe wrote downthe answer; with two members of the family reading and writing, there was no need forthe rest of them to learnPapa needed them at home.

Miss Mayella, said Atticus, in spite of himself, a nineteen-year-old girl like you musthave friends. Who are your friends?

The witness frowned as if puzzled. Friends?

Yes, dont you know anyone near your age, or older, or younger? Boys and girls?

Just ordinary friends?

Mayellas hostility, which had subsided to grudging neutrality, flared again. Youmakin fun ome agin, Mr. Finch?

Atticus let her question answer his.

Do you love your father, Miss Mayella? was his next.

Love him, whatcha mean?

I mean, is he good to you, is he easy to get along with?

He does tollable, cept when

Except when?

Mayella looked at her father, who was sitting with his chair tipped against the railing.

He sat up straight and waited for her to answer.

Except when nothin, said Mayella. I said he does tollable.

Mr. Ewell leaned back again.

Except when hes drinking? asked Atticus so gently that Mayella nodded.

Does he ever go after you?

How you mean?

When hesriled, has he ever beaten you?

Mayella looked around, down at the court reporter, up at the judge. Answer thequestion, Miss Mayella, said Judge Taylor.

My paws never touched a hair omy head in my life, she declared firmly. He nevertouched me.

Atticuss glasses had slipped a little, and he pushed them up on his nose. Weve hada good visit, Miss Mayella, and now I guess wed better get to the case. You say youasked Tom Robinson to come chop up awhat was it?

A chiffarobe, a old dresser full of drawers on one side.

Was Tom Robinson well known to you?

Whaddya mean?

I mean did you know who he was, where he lived?

Mayella nodded. I knowed who he was, he passed the house every day.

Was this the first time you asked him to come inside the fence?

Mayella jumped slightly at the question. Atticus was making his slow pilgrimage to thewindows, as he had been doing: he would ask a question, then look out, waiting for ananswer. He did not see her involuntary jump, but it seemed to me that he knew she hadmoved. He turned around and raised his eyebrows. Was he began again.

Yes it was.

Didnt you ever ask him to come inside the fence before?

She was prepared now. I did not, I certainly did not.

One did nots enough, said Atticus serenely. You never asked him to do odd jobs foryou before?

I mighta, conceded Mayella. There was several niggers around.

Can you remember any other occasions?

No.

All right, now to what happened. You said Tom Robinson was behind you in the roomwhen you turned around, that right?

Yes.

You said he got you around the neck cussing and saying dirtis that right?

ts right.

Atticuss memory had suddenly become accurate. You say he caught me andchoked me and took advantage of meis that right?

Thats what I said.

Do you remember him beating you about the face?

The witness hesitated.

You seem sure enough that he choked you. All this time you were fighting back,remember? You kicked and hollered as loud as you could. Do you remember himbeating you about the face?

Mayella was silent. She seemed to be trying to get something clear to herself. Ithought for a moment she was doing Mr. Heck Tates and my trick of pretending therewas a person in front of us. She glanced at Mr. Gilmer.

Its an easy question, Miss Mayella, so Ill try again. Do you remember him beatingyou about the face? Atticuss voice had lost its comfortableness; he was speaking in hisarid, detached professional voice. Do you remember him beating you about the face?

No, I dont recollect if he hit me. I mean yes I do, he hit me.

Was your last sentence your answer?

Huh? Yes, he hitI just dont remember, I just dont remember it all happened soquick.

Judge Taylor looked sternly at Mayella. Dont you cry, young woman he began,but Atticus said, Let her cry if she wants to, Judge. Weve got all the time in the world.

Mayella sniffed wrathfully and looked at Atticus. Ill answer any question you gotgetme up here an mock me, will you? Ill answer any question you got

Thats fine, said Atticus. Therere only a few more. Miss Mayella, not to be tedious,youve testified that the defendant hit you, grabbed you around the neck, choked you,and took advantage of you. I want you to be sure you have the right man. Will youidentify the man who raped you?

I will, thats him right yonder.

Atticus turned to the defendant. Tom, stand up. Let Miss Mayella have a good longlook at you. Is this the man, Miss Mayella?

Tom Robinsons powerful shoulders rippled under his thin shirt. He rose to his feet andstood with his right hand on the back of his chair. He looked oddly off balance, but it wasnot from the way he was standing. His left arm was fully twelve inches shorter than hisright, and hung dead at his side. It ended in a small shriveled hand, and from as faraway as the balcony I could see that it was no use to him.

Scout, breathed Jem. Scout, look! Reverend, hes crippled!

Reverend Sykes leaned across me and whispered to Jem. He got it caught in acotton gin, caught it in Mr. Dolphus Raymonds cotton gin when he was a boy like tobled to death tore all the muscles loose from his bones

Atticus said, Is this the man who raped you?

It most certainly is.

Atticuss next question was one word long. How?

Mayella was raging. I dont know how he done it, but he done itI said it allhappened so fast I

Now lets consider this calmly began Atticus, but Mr. Gilmer interrupted with anobjection: he was not irrelevant or immaterial, but Atticus was browbeating the witness.

Judge Taylor laughed outright. Oh sit down, Horace, hes doing nothing of the sort. Ifanything, the witnesss browbeating Atticus.

Judge Taylor was the only person in the courtroom who laughed. Even the babieswere still, and I suddenly wondered if they had been smothered at their mothers

breasts.

Now, said Atticus, Miss Mayella, youve testified that the defendant choked and beatyouyou didnt say that he sneaked up behind you and knocked you cold, but youturned around and there he was Atticus was back behind his table, and heemphasized his words by tapping his knuckles on it. do you wish to reconsider any ofyour testimony?

You want me to say something that didnt happen?

No maam, I want you to say something that did happen. Tell us once more, please,what happened?

I toldja what happened.

You testified that you turned around and there he was. He choked you then?

Yes.

Then he released your throat and hit you?

I said he did.

He blacked your left eye with his right fist?

I ducked and itit glanced, thats what it did. I ducked and it glanced off. Mayellahad finally seen the light.

Youre becoming suddenly clear on this point. A while ago you couldnt remember toowell, could you?

I said he hit me.

All right. He choked you, he hit you, then he raped you, that right?

It most certainly is.

Youre a strong girl, what were you doing all the time, just standing there?

I toldja I hollerednkickednfought

Atticus reached up and took off his glasses, turned his good right eye to the witness,and rained questions on her. Judge Taylor said, One question at a time, Atticus. Givethe witness a chance to answer.

All right, why didnt you run?

I tried

Tried to? What kept you from it?

Ihe slung me down. Thats what he did, he slung me downn got on top of me.

You were screaming all this time?

I certainly was.

Then why didnt the other children hear you? Where were they? At the dump?

Where were they?

No answer.

Why didnt your screams make them come running? The dumps closer than thewoods, isnt it?

No answer.

Or didnt you scream until you saw your father in the window? You didnt think toscream until then, did you?

No answer.

Did you scream first at your father instead of at Tom Robinson? Was that it?

No answer.

Who beat you up? Tom Robinson or your father?

No answer.

What did your father see in the window, the crime of rape or the best defense to it?

Why dont you tell the truth, child, didnt Bob Ewell beat you up?

When Atticus turned away from Mayella he looked like his stomach hurt, but Mayellasface was a mixture of terror and fury. Atticus sat down wearily and polished his glasseswith his handkerchief.

Suddenly Mayella became articulate. I got somethin to say, she said.

Atticus raised his head. Do you want to tell us what happened?

But she did not hear the compassion in his invitation. I got somethin to say an then Iaint gonna say no more. That nigger yonder took advantage of me an if you fine fancygentlemen dont wanta do nothin about it then youre all yellow stinkin cowards, stinkin

cowards, the lot of you. Your fancy airs dont come to nothinyour maamin and MissMayellerin dont come to nothin, Mr. Finch

Then she burst into real tears. Her shoulders shook with angry sobs. She was as goodas her word. She answered no more questions, even when Mr. Gilmer tried to get herback on the track. I guess if she hadnt been so poor and ignorant, Judge Taylor wouldhave put her under the jail for the contempt she had shown everybody in the courtroom.

Somehow, Atticus had hit her hard in a way that was not clear to me, but it gave him nopleasure to do so. He sat with his head down, and I never saw anybody glare at anyonewith the hatred Mayella showed when she left the stand and walked by Atticuss table.

When Mr. Gilmer told Judge Taylor that the state rested, Judge Taylor said, Its timewe all did. Well take ten minutes.

Atticus and Mr. Gilmer met in front of the bench and whispered, then they left thecourtroom by a door behind the witness stand, which was a signal for us all to stretch. Idiscovered that I had been sitting on the edge of the long bench, and I was somewhatnumb. Jem got up and yawned, Dill did likewise, and Reverend Sykes wiped his face onhis hat. The temperature was an easy ninety, he said.

Mr. Braxton Underwood, who had been sitting quietly in a chair reserved for the Press,soaking up testimony with his sponge of a brain, allowed his bitter eyes to rove over thecolored balcony, and they met mine. He gave a snort and looked away.

Jem, I said, Mr. Underwoods seen us.

Thats okay. He wont tell Atticus, hell just put it on the social side of the Tribune.

Jem turned back to Dill, explaining, I suppose, the finer points of the trial to him, but Iwondered what they were. There had been no lengthy debates between Atticus and Mr.

Gilmer on any points; Mr. Gilmer seemed to be prosecuting almost reluctantly;witnesses had been led by the nose as asses are, with few objections. But Atticus hadonce told us that in Judge Taylors court any lawyer who was a strict constructionist onevidence usually wound up receiving strict instructions from the bench. He distilled thisfor me to mean that Judge Taylor might look lazy and operate in his sleep, but he wasseldom reversed, and that was the proof of the pudding. Atticus said he was a goodjudge.

Presently Judge Taylor returned and climbed into his swivel chair. He took a cigarfrom his vest pocket and examined it thoughtfully. I punched Dill. Having passed thejudges inspection, the cigar suffered a vicious bite. We come down sometimes towatch him, I explained. Its gonna take him the rest of the afternoon, now. You watch.

Unaware of public scrutiny from above, Judge Taylor disposed of the severed end bypropelling it expertly to his lips and saying, Fhluck! He hit a spittoon so squarely wecould hear it slosh. Bet he was hell with a spitball, murmured Dill.

As a rule, a recess meant a general exodus, but today people werent moving. Eventhe Idlers who had failed to shame younger men from their seats had remained standingalong the walls. I guess Mr. Heck Tate had reserved the county toilet for court officials.

Atticus and Mr. Gilmer returned, and Judge Taylor looked at his watch. Its gettin onto four, he said, which was intriguing, as the courthouse clock must have struck thehour at least twice. I had not heard it or felt its vibrations.

Shall we try to wind up this afternoon? asked Judge Taylor. How bout it, Atticus?

I think we can, said Atticus.

How many witnesses you got?

One.

Well, call him.


Chapter 19

Thomas Robinson reached around, ran his fingers under his left arm and lifted it. Heguided his arm to the Bible and his rubber-like left hand sought contact with the blackbinding. As he raised his right hand, the useless one slipped off the Bible and hit theclerks table. He was trying again when Judge Taylor growled, Thatll do, Tom. Tomtook the oath and stepped into the witness chair. Atticus very quickly induced him to tellus:

Tom was twenty-five years of age; he was married with three children; he had been introuble with the law before: he once received thirty days for disorderly conduct.

It must have been disorderly, said Atticus. What did it consist of?

Got in a fight with another man, he tried to cut me.

Did he succeed?

Yes suh, a little, not enough to hurt. You see, I Tom moved his left shoulder.

Yes, said Atticus. You were both convicted?

Yes suh, I had to serve cause I couldnt pay the fine. Other fellow paid hisn.

Dill leaned across me and asked Jem what Atticus was doing. Jem said Atticus wasshowing the jury that Tom had nothing to hide.

Were you acquainted with Mayella Violet Ewell? asked Atticus.

Yes suh, I had to pass her place goin to and from the field every day.

Whose field?

I picks for Mr. Link Deas.

Were you picking cotton in November?

No suh, I works in his yard fall an wintertime. I works pretty steady for him all yearround, hes got a lot of pecan treesn things.

You say you had to pass the Ewell place to get to and from work. Is there any otherway to go?

No suh, nones I know of.

Tom, did she ever speak to you?

Why, yes suh, Id tip mhat when Id go by, and one day she asked me to come insidethe fence and bust up a chiffarobe for her.

When did she ask you to chop up thethe chiffarobe?

Mr. Finch, it was way last spring. I remember it because it was choppin time and Ihad my hoe with me. I said I didnt have nothin but this hoe, but she said she had ahatchet. She give me the hatchet and I broke up the chiffarobe. She said, I reckon Illhafta give you a nickel, wont I? an I said, No maam, there aint no charge. Then Iwent home. Mr. Finch, that was way last spring, way over a year ago.

Did you ever go on the place again?

Yes suh.

When?

Well, I went lots of times.

Judge Taylor instinctively reached for his gavel, but let his hand fall. The murmurbelow us died without his help.

Under what circumstances?

Please, suh?

Why did you go inside the fence lots of times?

Tom Robinsons forehead relaxed. Shed call me in, suh. Seemed like every time Ipassed by yonder shed have some little somethin for me to dochoppin kindlin, totin

water for her. She watered them red flowers every day

Were you paid for your services?

No suh, not after she offered me a nickel the first time. I was glad to do it, Mr. Ewelldidnt seem to help her none, and neither did the chillun, and I knowed she didnt haveno nickels to spare.

Where were the other children?

They was always around, all over the place. Theyd watch me work, some of em,some of emd set in the window.

Would Miss Mayella talk to you?

Yes sir, she talked to me.

As Tom Robinson gave his testimony, it came to me that Mayella Ewell must havebeen the loneliest person in the world. She was even lonelier than Boo Radley, who hadnot been out of the house in twenty-five years. When Atticus asked had she any friends,she seemed not to know what he meant, then she thought he was making fun of her.

She was as sad, I thought, as what Jem called a mixed child: white people wouldnthave anything to do with her because she lived among pigs; Negroes wouldnt haveanything to do with her because she was white. She couldnt live like Mr. DolphusRaymond, who preferred the company of Negroes, because she didnt own a riverbankand she wasnt from a fine old family. Nobody said, Thats just their way, about theEwells. Maycomb gave them Christmas baskets, welfare money, and the back of itshand. Tom Robinson was probably the only person who was ever decent to her. But shesaid he took advantage of her, and when she stood up she looked at him as if he weredirt beneath her feet.

Did you ever, Atticus interrupted my meditations, at any time, go on the Ewellpropertydid you ever set foot on the Ewell property without an express invitation fromone of them?

No suh, Mr. Finch, I never did. I wouldnt do that, suh.

Atticus sometimes said that one way to tell whether a witness was lying or telling thetruth was to listen rather than watch: I applied his testTom denied it three times in onebreath, but quietly, with no hint of whining in his voice, and I found myself believing himin spite of his protesting too much. He seemed to be a respectable Negro, and arespectable Negro would never go up into somebodys yard of his own volition.

Tom, what happened to you on the evening of November twenty-first of last year?

Below us, the spectators drew a collective breath and leaned forward. Behind us, theNegroes did the same.

Tom was a black-velvet Negro, not shiny, but soft black velvet. The whites of his eyesshone in his face, and when he spoke we saw flashes of his teeth. If he had been whole,he would have been a fine specimen of a man.

Mr. Finch, he said, I was goin home as usual that evenin, an when I passed theEwell place Miss Mayella were on the porch, like she said she were. It seemed realquiet like, an I didnt quite know why. I was studyin why, just passin by, when she saysfor me to come there and help her a minute. Well, I went inside the fence an lookedaround for some kindlin to work on, but I didnt see none, and she says, Naw, I gotsomethin for you to do in the house. Th old doors off its hinges an falls comin onpretty fast. I said you got a screwdriver, Miss Mayella? She said she sho had. Well, Iwent up the steps an she motioned me to come inside, and I went in the front room anlooked at the door. I said Miss Mayella, this door look all right. I pulled it backn forth andthose hinges was all right. Then she shet the door in my face. Mr. Finch, I was wonderin

why it was so quiet like, an it come to me that there werent a chile on the place, not aone of em, and I said Miss Mayella, where the chillun?

Toms black velvet skin had begun to shine, and he ran his hand over his face.

I say where the chillun? he continued, an she saysshe was laughin, sort ofshesays they all gone to town to get ice creams. She says, took me a slap year to savesebm nickels, but I done it. They all gone to town.

Toms discomfort was not from the humidity. What did you say then, Tom? askedAtticus.

I said somethin like, why Miss Mayella, thats right smart oyou to treat em. An shesaid, You think so? I dont think she understood what I was thinkinI meant it wassmart of her to save like that, an nice of her to treat em.

I understand you, Tom. Go on, said Atticus.

Well, I said I best be goin, I couldnt do nothin for her, an she says oh yes I could,an I ask her what, and she says to just step on that chair yonder an git that box downfrom on top of the chiffarobe.

Not the same chiffarobe you busted up? asked Atticus.

The witness smiled. Naw suh, another one. Most as tall as the room. So I done whatshe told me, an I was just reachin when the next thing I knows sheshed grabbed meround the legs, grabbed me round th legs, Mr. Finch. She scared me so bad I hoppeddown an turned the chair overthat was the only thing, only furniture, sturbed in thatroom, Mr. Finch, when I left it. I swear fore God.

What happened after you turned the chair over?

Tom Robinson had come to a dead stop. He glanced at Atticus, then at the jury, thenat Mr. Underwood sitting across the room.

Tom, youre sworn to tell the whole truth. Will you tell it?

Tom ran his hand nervously over his mouth.

What happened after that?

Answer the question, said Judge Taylor. One-third of his cigar had vanished.

Mr. Finch, I got down offa that chair an turned around an she sorta jumped on me.

Jumped on you? Violently?

No suh, sheshe hugged me. She hugged me round the waist.

This time Judge Taylors gavel came down with a bang, and as it did the overheadlights went on in the courtroom. Darkness had not come, but the afternoon sun had leftthe windows. Judge Taylor quickly restored order.

Then what did she do?

The witness swallowed hard. She reached up an kissed me side of th face. Shesays she never kissed a grown man before an she might as well kiss a nigger. Shesays what her papa do to her dont count. She says, Kiss me back, nigger. I say MissMayella lemme outa here an tried to run but she got her back to the door an Ida had topush her. I didnt wanta harm her, Mr. Finch, an I say lemme pass, but just when I say itMr. Ewell yonder hollered through th window.

What did he say?

Tom Robinson swallowed again, and his eyes widened. Somethin not fittin to saynot fittin for these folksn chillun to hear

What did he say, Tom? You must tell the jury what he said.

Tom Robinson shut his eyes tight. He says you goddamn whore, Ill kill ya.

Then what happened?

Mr. Finch, I was runnin so fast I didnt know what happened.

Tom, did you rape Mayella Ewell?

I did not, suh.

Did you harm her in any way?

I did not, suh.

Did you resist her advances?

Mr. Finch, I tried. I tried to thout bein ugly to her. I didnt wanta be ugly, I didnt wantapush her or nothin.

It occurred to me that in their own way, Tom Robinsons manners were as good asAtticuss. Until my father explained it to me later, I did not understand the subtlety ofToms predicament: he would not have dared strike a white woman under anycircumstances and expect to live long, so he took the first opportunity to runa suresign of guilt.

Tom, go back once more to Mr. Ewell, said Atticus. Did he say anything to you?

Not anything, suh. He mighta said somethin, but I werent there

Thatll do, Atticus cut in sharply. What you did hear, who was he talking to?

Mr. Finch, he were talkin and lookin at Miss Mayella.

Then you ran?

I sho did, suh.

Why did you run?

I was scared, suh.

Why were you scared?

Mr. Finch, if you was a nigger like me, youd be scared, too.

Atticus sat down. Mr. Gilmer was making his way to the witness stand, but before hegot there Mr. Link Deas rose from the audience and announced:

I just want the whole lot of you to know one thing right now. That boys worked for meeight years an I aint had a speck otrouble outa him. Not a speck.

Shut your mouth, sir! Judge Taylor was wide awake and roaring. He was also pink inthe face. His speech was miraculously unimpaired by his cigar. Link Deas, he yelled,if you have anything you want to say you can say it under oath and at the proper time,but until then you get out of this room, you hear me? Get out of this room, sir, you hearme? Ill be damned if Ill listen to this case again!

Judge Taylor looked daggers at Atticus, as if daring him to speak, but Atticus hadducked his head and was laughing into his lap. I remembered something he had saidabout Judge Taylors ex cathedra remarks sometimes exceeding his duty, but that fewlawyers ever did anything about them. I looked at Jem, but Jem shook his head. It aintlike one of the jurymen got up and started talking, he said. I think itd be different then.

Mr. Link was just disturbin the peace or something.

Judge Taylor told the reporter to expunge anything he happened to have written downafter Mr. Finch if you were a nigger like me youd be scared too, and told the jury todisregard the interruption. He looked suspiciously down the middle aisle and waited, Isuppose, for Mr. Link Deas to effect total departure. Then he said, Go ahead, Mr.

Gilmer.

You were given thirty days once for disorderly conduct, Robinson? asked Mr. Gilmer.

Yes suh.

Whatd the nigger look like when you got through with him?

He beat me, Mr. Gilmer.

Yes, but you were convicted, werent you?

Atticus raised his head. It was a misdemeanor and its in the record, Judge. I thoughthe sounded tired.

Witnessll answer, though, said Judge Taylor, just as wearily.

Yes suh, I got thirty days.

I knew that Mr. Gilmer would sincerely tell the jury that anyone who was convicted ofdisorderly conduct could easily have had it in his heart to take advantage of MayellaEwell, that was the only reason he cared. Reasons like that helped.

Robinson, youre pretty good at busting up chiffarobes and kindling with one hand,arent you?

Yes, suh, I reckon so.

Strong enough to choke the breath out of a woman and sling her to the floor?

I never done that, suh.

But you are strong enough to?

I reckon so, suh.

Had your eye on her a long time, hadnt you, boy?

No suh, I never looked at her.

Then you were mighty polite to do all that chopping and hauling for her, werent you,boy?

I was just tryin to help her out, suh.

That was mighty generous of you, you had chores at home after your regular work,didnt you?

Yes suh.

Why didnt you do them instead of Miss Ewells?

I done em both, suh.

You must have been pretty busy. Why?

Why what, suh?

Why were you so anxious to do that womans chores?

Tom Robinson hesitated, searching for an answer. Looked like she didnt havenobody to help her, like I says

With Mr. Ewell and seven children on the place, boy?

Well, I says it looked like they never help her none

You did all this chopping and work from sheer goodness, boy?

Tried to help her, I says.

Mr. Gilmer smiled grimly at the jury. Youre a mighty good fellow, it seemsdid allthis for not one penny?

Yes, suh. I felt right sorry for her, she seemed to try moren the rest of em

You felt sorry for her, you felt sorry for he? Mr. Gilmer seemed ready to rise to theceiling.

The witness realized his mistake and shifted uncomfortably in the chair. But thedamage was done. Below us, nobody liked Tom Robinsons answer. Mr. Gilmer pauseda long time to let it sink in.

Now you went by the house as usual, last November twenty-first, he said, and sheasked you to come in and bust up a chiffarobe?

No suh.

Do you deny that you went by the house?

No suhshe said she had somethin for me to do inside the house

She says she asked you to bust up a chiffarobe, is that right?

No suh, it aint.

Then you say shes lying, boy?

Atticus was on his feet, but Tom Robinson didnt need him. I dont say shes lyin, Mr.

Gilmer, I say shes mistaken in her mind.

To the next ten questions, as Mr. Gilmer reviewed Mayellas version of events, thewitnesss steady answer was that she was mistaken in her mind.

Didnt Mr. Ewell run you off the place, boy?

No suh, I dont think he did.

Dont think, what do you mean?

I mean I didnt stay long enough for him to run me off.

Youre very candid about this, why did you run so fast?

I says I was scared, suh.

If you had a clear conscience, why were you scared?

Like I says before, it werent safe for any nigger to be in afix like that.

But you werent in a fixyou testified that you were resisting Miss Ewell. Were you soscared that shed hurt you, you ran, a big buck like you?

No suh, Is scared Id be in court, just like I am now.

Scared of arrest, scared youd have to face up to what you did?

No suh, scared Id hafta face up to what I didnt do.

Are you being impudent to me, boy?

No suh, I didnt go to be.

This was as much as I heard of Mr. Gilmers cross-examination, because Jem mademe take Dill out. For some reason Dill had started crying and couldnt stop; quietly atfirst, then his sobs were heard by several people in the balcony. Jem said if I didnt gowith him hed make me, and Reverend Sykes said Id better go, so I went. Dill hadseemed to be all right that day, nothing wrong with him, but I guessed he hadnt fullyrecovered from running away.

Aint you feeling good? I asked, when we reached the bottom of the stairs.

Dill tried to pull himself together as we ran down the south steps. Mr. Link Deas was alonely figure on the top step. Anything happenin, Scout? he asked as we went by. Nosir, I answered over my shoulder. Dill here, hes sick.

Come on out under the trees, I said. Heat got you, I expect. We chose the fattestlive oak and we sat under it.

It was just him I couldnt stand, Dill said.

Who, Tom?

That old Mr. Gilmer doin him thataway, talking so hateful to him

Dill, thats his job. Why, if we didnt have prosecutorswell, we couldnt have defenseattorneys, I reckon.

Dill exhaled patiently. I know all that, Scout. It was the way he said it made me sick,plain sick.

Hes supposed to act that way, Dill, he was cross

He didnt act that way when

Dill, those were his own witnesses.

Well, Mr. Finch didnt act that way to Mayella and old man Ewell when he cross-examined them. The way that man called him boy all the time an sneered at him, an

looked around at the jury every time he answered

Well, Dill, after all hes just a Negro.

I dont care one speck. It aint right, somehow it aint right to do em that way. Hasntanybody got any business talkin like thatit just makes me sick.

Thats just Mr. Gilmers way, Dill, he does em all that way. Youve never seen him getgoodn down on one yet. Why, whenwell, today Mr. Gilmer seemed to me like hewasnt half trying. They do em all that way, most lawyers, I mean.

Mr. Finch doesnt.

Hes not an example, Dill, hes I was trying to grope in my memory for a sharpphrase of Miss Maudie Atkinsons. I had it: Hes the same in the courtroom as he is onthe public streets.

Thats not what I mean, said Dill.

I know what you mean, boy, said a voice behind us. We thought it came from thetree-trunk, but it belonged to Mr. Dolphus Raymond. He peered around the trunk at us.

You arent thin-hided, it just makes you sick, doesnt it?


Chapter 20

Come on round here, son, I got something thatll settle your stomach.

As Mr. Dolphus Raymond was an evil man I accepted his invitation reluctantly, but Ifollowed Dill. Somehow, I didnt think Atticus would like it if we became friendly with Mr.

Raymond, and I knew Aunt Alexandra wouldnt.

Here, he said, offering Dill his paper sack with straws in it. Take a good sip, itllquieten you.

Dill sucked on the straws, smiled, and pulled at length.

Hee hee, said Mr. Raymond, evidently taking delight in corrupting a child.

Dill, you watch out, now, I warned.

Dill released the straws and grinned. Scout, its nothing but Coca-Cola.

Mr. Raymond sat up against the tree-trunk. He had been lying on the grass. You littlefolks wont tell on me now, will you? Itd ruin my reputation if you did.

You mean all you drink in that sacks Coca-Cola? Just plain Coca-Cola?

Yes maam, Mr. Raymond nodded. I liked his smell: it was of leather, horses,cottonseed. He wore the only English riding boots I had ever seen. Thats all I drink,most of the time.

Then you just pretend youre half? I beg your pardon, sir, I caught myself. I didntmean to be

Mr. Raymond chuckled, not at all offended, and I tried to frame a discreet question:

Why do you do like you do?

Whoh yes, you mean why do I pretend? Well, its very simple, he said. Some folksdontlike the way I live. Now I could say the hell with em, I dont care if they dont likeit. I do say I dont care if they dont like it, right enoughbut I dont say the hell with em,see?

Dill and I said, No sir.

I try to give em a reason, you see. It helps folks if they can latch onto a reason. WhenI come to town, which is seldom, if I weave a little and drink out of this sack, folks cansay Dolphus Raymonds in the clutches of whiskeythats why he wont change hisways. He cant help himself, thats why he lives the way he does.

That aint honest, Mr. Raymond, making yourself out baddern you are already

It aint honest but its mighty helpful to folks. Secretly, Miss Finch, Im not much of adrinker, but you see they could never, never understand that I live like I do becausethats the way I want to live.

I had a feeling that I shouldnt be here listening to this sinful man who had mixedchildren and didnt care who knew it, but he was fascinating. I had never encountered abeing who deliberately perpetrated fraud against himself. But why had he entrusted uswith his deepest secret? I asked him why.

Because youre children and you can understand it, he said, and because I heardthat one

He jerked his head at Dill: Things havent caught up with that ones instinct yet. Lethim get a little older and he wont get sick and cry. Maybe thingsll strike him as beingnot quite right, say, but he wont cry, not when he gets a few years on him.

Cry about what, Mr. Raymond? Dills maleness was beginning to assert itself.

Cry about the simple hell people give other peoplewithout even thinking. Cry aboutthe hell white people give colored folks, without even stopping to think that theyrepeople, too.

Atticus says cheatin a colored man is ten times worse than cheatin a white man, Imuttered. Says its the worst thing you can do.

Mr. Raymond said, I dont reckon itsMiss Jean Louise, you dont know your pasnot a run-of-the-mill man, itll take a few years for that to sink inyou havent seenenough of the world yet. You havent even seen this town, but all you gotta do is stepback inside the courthouse.

Which reminded me that we were missing nearly all of Mr. Gilmers cross-examination.

I looked at the sun, and it was dropping fast behind the store-tops on the west side ofthe square. Between two fires, I could not decide which I wanted to jump into: Mr.

Raymond or the 5th Judicial Circuit Court. Cmon, Dill, I said. You all right, now?

Yeah. Glad tve metcha, Mr. Raymond, and thanks for the drink, it was mightysettlin.

We raced back to the courthouse, up the steps, up two flights of stairs, and edged ourway along the balcony rail. Reverend Sykes had saved our seats.

The courtroom was still, and again I wondered where the babies were. Judge Taylorscigar was a brown speck in the center of his mouth; Mr. Gilmer was writing on one of theyellow pads on his table, trying to outdo the court reporter, whose hand was jerkingrapidly. Shoot, I muttered, we missed it.

Atticus was halfway through his speech to the jury. He had evidently pulled somepapers from his briefcase that rested beside his chair, because they were on his table.

Tom Robinson was toying with them.

absence of any corroborative evidence, this man was indicted on a capital chargeand is now on trial for his life

I punched Jem. How longs he been at it?

Hes just gone over the evidence, Jem whispered, and were gonna win, Scout. Idont see how we cant. Hes been at it bout five minutes. He made it as plain and easyaswell, as Ida explained it to you. You couldve understood it, even.

Did Mr. Gilmer?

Sh-h. Nothing new, just the usual. Hush now.

We looked down again. Atticus was speaking easily, with the kind of detachment heused when he dictated a letter. He walked slowly up and down in front of the jury, andthe jury seemed to be attentive: their heads were up, and they followed Atticuss routewith what seemed to be appreciation. I guess it was because Atticus wasnt a thunderer.

Atticus paused, then he did something he didnt ordinarily do. He unhitched his watchand chain and placed them on the table, saying, With the courts permission

Judge Taylor nodded, and then Atticus did something I never saw him do before orsince, in public or in private: he unbuttoned his vest, unbuttoned his collar, loosened histie, and took off his coat. He never loosened a scrap of his clothing until he undressed atbedtime, and to Jem and me, this was the equivalent of him standing before us starknaked. We exchanged horrified glances.

Atticus put his hands in his pockets, and as he returned to the jury, I saw his goldcollar button and the tips of his pen and pencil winking in the light.

Gentlemen, he said. Jem and I again looked at each other: Atticus might have said,Scout. His voice had lost its aridity, its detachment, and he was talking to the jury as ifthey were folks on the post office corner.

Gentlemen, he was saying, I shall be brief, but I would like to use my remaining timewith you to remind you that this case is not a difficult one, it requires no minute sifting ofcomplicated facts, but it does require you to be sure beyond all reasonable doubt as tothe guilt of the defendant. To begin with, this case should never have come to trial. Thiscase is as simple as black and white.

The state has not produced one iota of medical evidence to the effect that the crimeTom Robinson is charged with ever took place. It has relied instead upon the testimonyof two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into serious question oncross-examination, but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant. The defendant isnot guilty, but somebody in this courtroom is.

I have nothing but pity in my heart for the chief witness for the state, but my pity doesnot extend so far as to her putting a mans life at stake, which she has done in an effortto get rid of her own guilt.

I say guilt, gentlemen, because it was guilt that motivated her. She has committed nocrime, she has merely broken a rigid and time-honored code of our society, a code sosevere that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst as unfit to live with. She is thevictim of cruel poverty and ignorance, but I cannot pity her: she is white. She knew fullwell the enormity of her offense, but because her desires were stronger than the codeshe was breaking, she persisted in breaking it. She persisted, and her subsequentreaction is something that all of us have known at one time or another. She didsomething every child has doneshe tried to put the evidence of her offense away fromher. But in this case she was no child hiding stolen contraband: she struck out at hervictimof necessity she must put him away from herhe must be removed from herpresence, from this world. She must destroy the evidence of her offense.

What was the evidence of her offense? Tom Robinson, a human being. She must putTom Robinson away from her. Tom Robinson was her daily reminder of what she did.

What did she do? She tempted a Negro.

She was white, and she tempted a Negro. She did something that in our society isunspeakable: she kissed a black man. Not an old Uncle, but a strong young Negro man.

No code mattered to her before she broke it, but it came crashing down on herafterwards.

Her father saw it, and the defendant has testified as to his remarks. What did herfather do? We dont know, but there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that MayellaEwell was beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with his left. We doknow in part what Mr. Ewell did: he did what any God-fearing, persevering, respectablewhite man would do under the circumstanceshe swore out a warrant, no doubt signingit with his left hand, and Tom Robinson now sits before you, having taken the oath withthe only good hand he possesseshis right hand.

And so a quiet, respectable, humble Negro who had the unmitigated temerity to feelsorry for a white woman has had to put his word against two white peoples. I need notremind you of their appearance and conduct on the standyou saw them foryourselves. The witnesses for the state, with the exception of the sheriff of MaycombCounty, have presented themselves to you gentlemen, to this court, in the cynicalconfidence that their testimony would not be doubted, confident that you gentlemenwould go along with them on the assumptionthe evil assumptionthat all Negroes lie,that all Negroes are basically immoral beings, that all Negro men are not to be trustedaround our women, an assumption one associates with minds of their caliber.

Which, gentlemen, we know is in itself a lie as black as Tom Robinsons skin, a lie Ido not have to point out to you. You know the truth, and the truth is this: some Negroeslie, some Negroes are immoral, some Negro men are not to be trusted around womenblack or white. But this is a truth that applies to the human race and to no particular raceof men. There is not a person in this courtroom who has never told a lie, who has neverdone an immoral thing, and there is no man living who has never looked upon a womanwithout desire.

Atticus paused and took out his handkerchief. Then he took off his glasses and wipedthem, and we saw another first: we had never seen him sweathe was one of thosemen whose faces never perspired, but now it was shining tan.

One more thing, gentlemen, before I quit. Thomas Jefferson once said that all menare created equal, a phrase that the Yankees and the distaff side of the Executivebranch in Washington are fond of hurling at us. There is a tendency in this year of grace,1935, for certain people to use this phrase out of context, to satisfy all conditions. Themost ridiculous example I can think of is that the people who run public educationpromote the stupid and idle along with the industriousbecause all men are createdequal, educators will gravely tell you, the children left behind suffer terrible feelings ofinferiority. We know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would haveus believesome people are smarter than others, some people have more opportunitybecause theyre born with it, some men make more money than others, some ladiesmake better cakes than otherssome people are born gifted beyond the normal scopeof most men.

But there is one way in this country in which all men are created equalthere is onehuman institution that makes a pauper the equal of a Rockefeller, the stupid man theequal of an Einstein, and the ignorant man the equal of any college president. Thatinstitution, gentlemen, is a court. It can be the Supreme Court of the United States or thehumblest J.P. court in the land, or this honorable court which you serve. Our courts havetheir faults, as does any human institution, but in this country our courts are the greatlevelers, and in our courts all men are created equal.

Im no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our courts and in the jury systemthat is no ideal to me, it is a living, working reality. Gentlemen, a court is no better thaneach man of you sitting before me on this jury. A court is only as sound as its jury, and ajury is only as sound as the men who make it up. I am confident that you gentlemen willreview without passion the evidence you have heard, come to a decision, and restorethis defendant to his family. In the name of God, do your duty.

Atticuss voice had dropped, and as he turned away from the jury he said something Idid not catch. He said it more to himself than to the court. I punched Jem. Whatd hesay?

In the name of God, believe him, I think thats what he said.

Dill suddenly reached over me and tugged at Jem. Looka yonder!

We followed his finger with sinking hearts. Calpurnia was making her way up themiddle aisle, walking straight toward Atticus.


Chapter 21

She stopped shyly at the railing and waited to get Judge Taylors attention. She was ina fresh apron and she carried an envelope in her hand.

Judge Taylor saw her and said, Its Calpurnia, isnt it?

Yes sir, she said. Could I just pass this note to Mr. Finch, please sir? It hasnt gotanything to do withwith the trial.

Judge Taylor nodded and Atticus took the envelope from Calpurnia. He opened it,read its contents and said, Judge, Ithis note is from my sister. She says my childrenare missing, havent turned up since noon I could you

I know where they are, Atticus. Mr. Underwood spoke up. Theyre right up yonder inthe colored balconybeen there since precisely one-eighteen P.M.

Our father turned around and looked up. Jem, come down from there, he called.

Then he said something to the Judge we didnt hear. We climbed across ReverendSykes and made our way to the staircase.

Atticus and Calpurnia met us downstairs. Calpurnia looked peeved, but Atticus lookedexhausted.

Jem was jumping in excitement. Weve won, havent we?

Ive no idea, said Atticus shortly. Youve been here all afternoon? Go home withCalpurnia and get your supperand stay home.

Aw, Atticus, let us come back, pleaded Jem. Please let us hear the verdict, pleasesir.

The jury might be out and back in a minute, we dont know but we could tell Atticuswas relenting. Well, youve heard it all, so you might as well hear the rest. Tell youwhat, you all can come back when youve eaten your suppereat slowly, now, youwont miss anything importantand if the jurys still out, you can wait with us. But Iexpect itll be over before you get back.

You think theyll acquit him that fast? asked Jem.

Atticus opened his mouth to answer, but shut it and left us.

I prayed that Reverend Sykes would save our seats for us, but stopped praying when Iremembered that people got up and left in droves when the jury was outtonight, theydoverrun the drugstore, the O.K. Caf and the hotel, that is, unless they had brought theirsuppers too.

Calpurnia marched us home: skin every one of you alive, the very idea, youchildren listenin to all that! Mister Jem, dont you know bettern to take your little sister tothat trial? Miss Alexandrall absolutely have a stroke of paralysis when she finds out!

Aint fittin for children to hear

The streetlights were on, and we glimpsed Calpurnias indignant profile as we passedbeneath them. Mister Jem, I thought you was gettin some kinda head on yourshouldersthe very idea, shes your little sister! The very idea, sir! You oughta beperfectly ashamed of yourselfaint you got any sense at all?

I was exhilarated. So many things had happened so fast I felt it would take years tosort them out, and now here was Calpurnia giving her precious Jem down the countrywhat new marvels would the evening bring?

Jem was chuckling. Dont you want to hear about it, Cal?

Hush your mouth, sir! When you oughta be hangin your head in shame you go alonglaughin Calpurnia revived a series of rusty threats that moved Jem to little remorse,and she sailed up the front steps with her classic, If Mr. Finch dont wear you out, Iwillget in that house, sir!

Jem went in grinning, and Calpurnia nodded tacit consent to having Dill in to supper.

You all call Miss Rachel right now and tell her where you are, she told him. Shes rundistracted lookin for youyou watch out she dont ship you back to Meridian first thingin the mornin.

Aunt Alexandra met us and nearly fainted when Calpurnia told her where we were. Iguess it hurt her when we told her Atticus said we could go back, because she didntsay a word during supper. She just rearranged food on her plate, looking at it sadlywhile Calpurnia served Jem, Dill and me with a vengeance. Calpurnia poured milk,dished out potato salad and ham, muttering, shamed of yourselves, in varyingdegrees of intensity. Now you all eat slow, was her final command.

Reverend Sykes had saved our places. We were surprised to find that we had beengone nearly an hour, and were equally surprised to find the courtroom exactly as we hadleft it, with minor changes: the jury box was empty, the defendant was gone; JudgeTaylor had been gone, but he reappeared as we were seating ourselves.

Nobodys moved, hardly, said Jem.

They moved around some when the jury went out, said Reverend Sykes. Themenfolk down there got the womenfolk their suppers, and they fed their babies.

How long have they been out? asked Jem.

bout thirty minutes. Mr. Finch and Mr. Gilmer did some more talkin, and JudgeTaylor charged the jury.

How was he? asked Jem.

What say? Oh, he did right well. I aint complainin one bithe was mighty fair-minded. He sorta said if you believe this, then youll have to return one verdict, but if youbelieve this, youll have to return another one. I thought he was leanin a little to ourside Reverend Sykes scratched his head.

Jem smiled. Hes not supposed to lean, Reverend, but dont fret, weve won it, hesaid wisely. Dont see how any jury could convict on what we heard

Now dont you be so confident, Mr. Jem, I aint ever seen any jury decide in favor of acolored man over a white man But Jem took exception to Reverend Sykes, and wewere subjected to a lengthy review of the evidence with Jems ideas on the lawregarding rape: it wasnt rape if she let you, but she had to be eighteenin Alabama,that isand Mayella was nineteen. Apparently you had to kick and holler, you had to beoverpowered and stomped on, preferably knocked stone cold. If you were undereighteen, you didnt have to go through all this.

Mr. Jem, Reverend Sykes demurred, this aint a polite thing for little ladies tohear

Aw, she doesnt know what were talkin about, said Jem. Scout, this is too old foryou, aint it?

It most certainly is not, I know every word youre saying. Perhaps I was tooconvincing, because Jem hushed and never discussed the subject again.

What time is it, Reverend? he asked.

Gettin on toward eight.

I looked down and saw Atticus strolling around with his hands in his pockets: he madea tour of the windows, then walked by the railing over to the jury box. He looked in it,inspected Judge Taylor on his throne, then went back to where he started. I caught hiseye and waved to him. He acknowledged my salute with a nod, and resumed his tour.

Mr. Gilmer was standing at the windows talking to Mr. Underwood. Bert, the courtreporter, was chain-smoking: he sat back with his feet on the table.

But the officers of the court, the ones presentAtticus, Mr. Gilmer, Judge Taylorsound asleep, and Bert, were the only ones whose behavior seemed normal. I hadnever seen a packed courtroom so still. Sometimes a baby would cry out fretfully, and achild would scurry out, but the grown people sat as if they were in church. In thebalcony, the Negroes sat and stood around us with biblical patience.

The old courthouse clock suffered its preliminary strain and struck the hour, eightdeafening bongs that shook our bones.

When it bonged eleven times I was past feeling: tired from fighting sleep, I allowedmyself a short nap against Reverend Sykess comfortable arm and shoulder. I jerkedawake and made an honest effort to remain so, by looking down and concentrating onthe heads below: there were sixteen bald ones, fourteen men that could pass forredheads, forty heads varying between brown and black, andI rememberedsomething Jem had once explained to me when he went through a brief period ofpsychical research: he said if enough peoplea stadium full, maybewere toconcentrate on one thing, such as setting a tree afire in the woods, that the tree wouldignite of its own accord. I toyed with the idea of asking everyone below to concentrateon setting Tom Robinson free, but thought if they were as tired as I, it wouldnt work.

Dill was sound asleep, his head on Jems shoulder, and Jem was quiet.

Aint it a long time? I asked him.

Sure is, Scout, he said happily.

Well, from the way you put it, itd just take five minutes.

Jem raised his eyebrows. There are things you dont understand, he said, and I wastoo weary to argue.

But I must have been reasonably awake, or I would not have received the impressionthat was creeping into me. It was not unlike one I had last winter, and I shivered, thoughthe night was hot. The feeling grew until the atmosphere in the courtroom was exactlythe same as a cold February morning, when the mockingbirds were still, and thecarpenters had stopped hammering on Miss Maudies new house, and every wood doorin the neighborhood was shut as tight as the doors of the Radley Place. A deserted,waiting, empty street, and the courtroom was packed with people. A steaming summernight was no different from a winter morning. Mr. Heck Tate, who had entered thecourtroom and was talking to Atticus, might have been wearing his high boots andlumber jacket. Atticus had stopped his tranquil journey and had put his foot onto thebottom rung of a chair; as he listened to what Mr. Tate was saying, he ran his handslowly up and down his thigh. I expected Mr. Tate to say any minute, Take him, Mr.

Finch

But Mr. Tate said, This court will come to order, in a voice that rang with authority,and the heads below us jerked up. Mr. Tate left the room and returned with TomRobinson. He steered Tom to his place beside Atticus, and stood there. Judge Taylorhad roused himself to sudden alertness and was sitting up straight, looking at the emptyjury box.

What happened after that had a dreamlike quality: in a dream I saw the jury return,moving like underwater swimmers, and Judge Taylors voice came from far away andwas tiny. I saw something only a lawyers child could be expected to see, could beexpected to watch for, and it was like watching Atticus walk into the street, raise a rifle tohis shoulder and pull the trigger, but watching all the time knowing that the gun wasempty.

A jury never looks at a defendant it has convicted, and when this jury came in, not oneof them looked at Tom Robinson. The foreman handed a piece of paper to Mr. Tate whohanded it to the clerk who handed it to the judgeI shut my eyes. Judge Taylor was polling the jury: Guilty guilty guilty guilty Ipeeked at Jem: his hands were white from gripping the balcony rail, and his shouldersjerked as if each guilty was a separate stab between them.

Judge Taylor was saying something. His gavel was in his fist, but he wasnt using it.

Dimly, I saw Atticus pushing papers from the table into his briefcase. He snapped itshut, went to the court reporter and said something, nodded to Mr. Gilmer, and thenwent to Tom Robinson and whispered something to him. Atticus put his hand on Tomsshoulder as he whispered. Atticus took his coat off the back of his chair and pulled itover his shoulder. Then he left the courtroom, but not by his usual exit. He must havewanted to go home the short way, because he walked quickly down the middle aisletoward the south exit. I followed the top of his head as he made his way to the door. Hedid not look up.

Someone was punching me, but I was reluctant to take my eyes from the peoplebelow us, and from the image of Atticuss lonely walk down the aisle.

Miss Jean Louise?

I looked around. They were standing. All around us and in the balcony on the oppositewall, the Negroes were getting to their feet. Reverend Sykess voice was as distant asJudge Taylors:

Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your fathers passin.


Chapter 22

It was Jems turn to cry. His face was streaked with angry tears as we made our waythrough the cheerful crowd. It aint right, he muttered, all the way to the corner of thesquare where we found Atticus waiting. Atticus was standing under the street lightlooking as though nothing had happened: his vest was buttoned, his collar and tie wereneatly in place, his watch-chain glistened, he was his impassive self again.

It aint right, Atticus, said Jem.

No son, its not right.

We walked home.

Aunt Alexandra was waiting up. She was in her dressing gown, and I could havesworn she had on her corset underneath it. Im sorry, brother, she murmured. Havingnever heard her call Atticus brother before, I stole a glance at Jem, but he was notlistening. He would look up at Atticus, then down at the floor, and I wondered if hethought Atticus somehow responsible for Tom Robinsons conviction.

Is he all right? Aunty asked, indicating Jem.

Hell be so presently, said Atticus. It was a little too strong for him. Our fathersighed. Im going to bed, he said. If I dont wake up in the morning, dont call me.

I didnt think it wise in the first place to let them

This is their home, sister, said Atticus. Weve made it this way for them, they mightas well learn to cope with it.

But they dont have to go to the courthouse and wallow in it

Its just as much Maycomb County as missionary teas.

Atticus Aunt Alexandras eyes were anxious. You are the last person I thoughtwould turn bitter over this.

Im not bitter, just tired. Im going to bed.

Atticus said Jem bleakly.

He turned in the doorway. What, son?

How could they do it, how could they?

I dont know, but they did it. Theyve done it before and they did it tonight and theylldo it again and when they do itseems that only children weep. Good night.

But things are always better in the morning. Atticus rose at his usual ungodly hour andwas in the livingroom behind the Mobile Register when we stumbled in. Jems morningface posed the question his sleepy lips struggled to ask.

Its not time to worry yet, Atticus reassured him, as we went to the diningroom.

Were not through yet. Therell be an appeal, you can count on that. Gracious alive,Cal, whats all this? He was staring at his breakfast plate.

Calpurnia said, Tom Robinsons daddy sent you along this chicken this morning. Ifixed it.

You tell him Im proud to get itbet they dont have chicken for breakfast at the WhiteHouse. What are these?

Rolls, said Calpurnia. Estelle down at the hotel sent em.

Atticus looked up at her, puzzled, and she said, You better step out here and seewhats in the kitchen, Mr. Finch.

We followed him. The kitchen table was loaded with enough food to bury the family:

hunks of salt pork, tomatoes, beans, even scuppernongs. Atticus grinned when he founda jar of pickled pigs knuckles. Reckon Auntyll let me eat these in the diningroom?

Calpurnia said, This was all round the back steps when I got here this morning.

Theythey preciate what you did, Mr. Finch. Theythey arent oversteppinthemselves, are they?

Atticuss eyes filled with tears. He did not speak for a moment. Tell them Im verygrateful, he said. Tell themtell them they must never do this again. Times are toohard

He left the kitchen, went in the diningroom and excused himself to Aunt Alexandra, puton his hat and went to town.

We heard Dills step in the hall, so Calpurnia left Atticuss uneaten breakfast on thetable. Between rabbit-bites Dill told us of Miss Rachels reaction to last night, which was:

if a man like Atticus Finch wants to butt his head against a stone wall its his head.

Ida got her told, growled Dill, gnawing a chicken leg, but she didnt look much liketellin this morning. Said she was up half the night wonderin where I was, said shedahad the sheriff after me but he was at the hearing.

Dill, youve got to stop goin off without tellin her, said Jem. It just aggravates her.

Dill sighed patiently. I told her till I was blue in the face where I was goinshes justseein too many snakes in the closet. Bet that woman drinks a pint for breakfast everymorningknow she drinks two glasses full. Seen her.

Dont talk like that, Dill, said Aunt Alexandra. Its not becoming to a child. Itscynical.

I aint cynical, Miss Alexandra. Tellin the truths not cynical, is it?

The way you tell it, it is.

Jems eyes flashed at her, but he said to Dill, Lets go. You can take that runner withyou.

When we went to the front porch, Miss Stephanie Crawford was busy telling it to MissMaudie Atkinson and Mr. Avery. They looked around at us and went on talking. Jemmade a feral noise in his throat. I wished for a weapon.

I hate grown folks lookin at you, said Dill. Makes you feel like youve donesomething.

Miss Maudie yelled for Jem Finch to come there.

Jem groaned and heaved himself up from the swing. Well go with you, Dill said.

Miss Stephanies nose quivered with curiosity. She wanted to know who all gave uspermission to go to courtshe didnt see us but it was all over town this morning that wewere in the Colored balcony. Did Atticus put us up there as a sort of? Wasnt it rightclose up there with all those? Did Scout understand all the? Didnt it make us madto see our daddy beat?

Hush, Stephanie. Miss Maudies diction was deadly. Ive not got all the morning topass on the porchJem Finch, I called to find out if you and your colleagues can eatsome cake. Got up at five to make it, so you better say yes. Excuse us, Stephanie.

Good morning, Mr. Avery.

There was a big cake and two little ones on Miss Maudies kitchen table. There shouldhave been three little ones. It was not like Miss Maudie to forget Dill, and we must haveshown it. But we understood when she cut from the big cake and gave the slice to Jem.

As we ate, we sensed that this was Miss Maudies way of saying that as far as shewas concerned, nothing had changed. She sat quietly in a kitchen chair, watching us.

Suddenly she spoke: Dont fret, Jem. Things are never as bad as they seem.

Indoors, when Miss Maudie wanted to say something lengthy she spread her fingerson her knees and settled her bridgework. This she did, and we waited.

I simply want to tell you that there are some men in this world who were born to doour unpleasant jobs for us. Your fathers one of them.

Oh, said Jem. Well.

Dont you oh well me, sir, Miss Maudie replied, recognizing Jems fatalistic noises,you are not old enough to appreciate what I said.

Jem was staring at his half-eaten cake. Its like bein a caterpillar in a cocoon, thatswhat it is, he said. Like somethin asleep wrapped up in a warm place. I always thoughtMaycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least thats what they seemed like.

Were the safest folks in the world, said Miss Maudie. Were so rarely called on tobe Christians, but when we are, weve got men like Atticus to go for us.

Jem grinned ruefully. Wish the rest of the county thought that.

Youd be surprised how many of us do.

Who? Jems voice rose. Who in this town did one thing to help Tom Robinson, justwho?

His colored friends for one thing, and people like us. People like Judge Taylor. Peoplelike Mr. Heck Tate. Stop eating and start thinking, Jem. Did it ever strike you that JudgeTaylor naming Atticus to defend that boy was no accident? That Judge Taylor mighthave had his reasons for naming him?

This was a thought. Court-appointed defenses were usually given to Maxwell Green,Maycombs latest addition to the bar, who needed the experience. Maxwell Greenshould have had Tom Robinsons case.

You think about that, Miss Maudie was saying. It was no accident. I was sittin thereon the porch last night, waiting. I waited and waited to see you all come down thesidewalk, and as I waited I thought, Atticus Finch wont win, he cant win, but hes theonly man in these parts who can keep a jury out so long in a case like that. And Ithought to myself, well, were making a stepits just a baby-step, but its a step.

ts all right to talk like thatcant any Christian judges an lawyers make up forheathen juries, Jem muttered. Soons I get grown

Thats something youll have to take up with your father, Miss Maudie said.

We went down Miss Maudies cool new steps into the sunshine and found Mr. Averyand Miss Stephanie Crawford still at it. They had moved down the sidewalk and werestanding in front of Miss Stephanies house. Miss Rachel was walking toward them.

I think Ill be a clown when I get grown, said Dill.

Jem and I stopped in our tracks.

Yes sir, a clown, he said. There aint one thing in this world I can do about folksexcept laugh, so Im gonna join the circus and laugh my head off.

You got it backwards, Dill, said Jem. Clowns are sad, its folks that laugh at them.

Well Im gonna be a new kind of clown. Im gonna stand in the middle of the ring andlaugh at the folks. Just looka yonder, he pointed. Every one of em oughta be ridin

broomsticks. Aunt Rachel already does.

Miss Stephanie and Miss Rachel were waving wildly at us, in a way that did not givethe lie to Dills observation.

Oh gosh, breathed Jem. I reckon itd be ugly not to see em.

Something was wrong. Mr. Avery was red in the face from a sneezing spell and nearlyblew us off the sidewalk when we came up. Miss Stephanie was trembling withexcitement, and Miss Rachel caught Dills shoulder. You get on in the back yard andstay there, she said. Theres danger acomin.

s matter? I asked.

Aint you heard yet? Its all over town

At that moment Aunt Alexandra came to the door and called us, but she was too late.

It was Miss Stephanies pleasure to tell us: this morning Mr. Bob Ewell stopped Atticuson the post office corner, spat in his face, and told him hed get him if it took the rest ofhis life.

Chapter 23

I wish Bob Ewell wouldnt chew tobacco, was all Atticus said about it.

According to Miss Stephanie Crawford, however, Atticus was leaving the post officewhen Mr. Ewell approached him, cursed him, spat on him, and threatened to kill him.

Miss Stephanie (who, by the time she had told it twice was there and had seen it allpassing by from the Jitney Jungle, she was)Miss Stephanie said Atticus didnt bat aneye, just took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and stood there and let Mr. Ewellcall him names wild horses could not bring her to repeat. Mr. Ewell was a veteran of anobscure war; that plus Atticuss peaceful reaction probably prompted him to inquire,Too proud to fight, you nigger-lovin bastard? Miss Stephanie said Atticus said, No,too old, put his hands in his pockets and strolled on. Miss Stephanie said you had tohand it to Atticus Finch, he could be right dry sometimes.

Jem and I didnt think it entertaining.

After all, though, I said, he was the deadest shot in the county one time. He could

You know he wouldnt carry a gun, Scout. He aint even got one said Jem. Youknow he didnt even have one down at the jail that night. He told me havin a gunarounds an invitation to somebody to shoot you.

This is different, I said. We can ask him to borrow one.

We did, and he said, Nonsense.

Dill was of the opinion that an appeal to Atticuss better nature might work: after all, wewould starve if Mr. Ewell killed him, besides be raised exclusively by Aunt Alexandra,and we all knew the first thing shed do before Atticus was under the ground good wouldbe to fire Calpurnia. Jem said it might work if I cried and flung a fit, being young and agirl. That didnt work either. But when he noticed us dragging around the neighborhood,not eating, taking little interest in our normal pursuits, Atticus discovered how deeplyfrightened we were. He tempted Jem with a new football magazine one night; when hesaw Jem flip the pages and toss it aside, he said, Whats bothering you, son?

Jem came to the point: Mr. Ewell.

What has happened?

Nothings happened. Were scared for you, and we think you oughta do somethingabout him.

Atticus smiled wryly. Do what? Put him under a peace bond?

When a man says hes gonna get you, looks like he means it.

He meant it when he said it, said Atticus. Jem, see if you can stand in Bob Ewellsshoes a minute. I destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he had any to beginwith. The man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind always does. So if spittingin my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewell one extra beating, thats somethingIll gladly take. He had to take it out on somebody and Id rather it be me than thathouseful of children out there. You understand?

Jem nodded.

Aunt Alexandra entered the room as Atticus was saying, We dont have anything tofear from Bob Ewell, he got it all out of his system that morning.

I wouldnt be so sure of that, Atticus, she said. His kindd do anything to pay off agrudge. You know how those people are.

What on earth could Ewell do to me, sister?

Something furtive, Aunt Alexandra said. You may count on that.

Nobody has much chance to be furtive in Maycomb, Atticus answered.

After that, we were not afraid. Summer was melting away, and we made the most of it.

Atticus assured us that nothing would happen to Tom Robinson until the higher courtreviewed his case, and that Tom had a good chance of going free, or at least of havinga new trial. He was at Enfield Prison Farm, seventy miles away in Chester County. Iasked Atticus if Toms wife and children were allowed to visit him, but Atticus said no.

If he loses his appeal, I asked one evening, whatll happen to him?

Hell go to the chair, said Atticus, unless the Governor commutes his sentence. Nottime to worry yet, Scout. Weve got a good chance.

Jem was sprawled on the sofa reading Popular Mechanics. He looked up. It aintright. He didnt kill anybody even if he was guilty. He didnt take anybodys life.

You know rapes a capital offense in Alabama, said Atticus.

Yessir, but the jury didnt have to give him deathif they wanted to they couldvegave him twenty years.

Given, said Atticus. Tom Robinsons a colored man, Jem. No jury in this part of theworlds going to say, We think youre guilty, but not very, on a charge like that. It waseither a straight acquittal or nothing.

Jem was shaking his head. I know its not right, but I cant figure out whats wrongmaybe rape shouldnt be a capital offense

Atticus dropped his newspaper beside his chair. He said he didnt have any quarrelwith the rape statute, none what ever, but he did have deep misgivings when the stateasked for and the jury gave a death penalty on purely circumstantial evidence. Heglanced at me, saw I was listening, and made it easier. I mean, before a man issentenced to death for murder, say, there should be one or two eye-witnesses. Someone should be able to say, Yes, I was there and saw him pull the trigger.

But lots of folks have been hunghangedon circumstantial evidence, said Jem.

I know, and lots of em probably deserved it, toobut in the absence of eye-witnesses theres always a doubt, some times only the shadow of a doubt. The law saysreasonable doubt, but I think a defendants entitled to the shadow of a doubt. Theresalways the possibility, no matter how improbable, that hes innocent.

Then it all goes back to the jury, then. We oughta do away with juries. Jem wasadamant.

Atticus tried hard not to smile but couldnt help it. Youre rather hard on us, son. Ithink maybe there might be a better way. Change the law. Change it so that only judgeshave the power of fixing the penalty in capital cases.

Then go up to Montgomery and change the law.

Youd be surprised how hard thatd be. I wont live to see the law changed, and if youlive to see it youll be an old man.

This was not good enough for Jem. No sir, they oughta do away with juries. Hewasnt guilty in the first place and they said he was.

If you had been on that jury, son, and eleven other boys like you, Tom would be afree man, said Atticus. So far nothing in your life has interfered with your reasoningprocess. Those are twelve reasonable men in everyday life, Toms jury, but you sawsomething come between them and reason. You saw the same thing that night in frontof the jail. When that crew went away, they didnt go as reasonable men, they wentbecause we were there. Theres something in our world that makes men lose theirheadsthey couldnt be fair if they tried. In our courts, when its a white mans wordagainst a black mans, the white man always wins. Theyre ugly, but those are the factsof life.

Doesnt make it right, said Jem stolidly. He beat his fist softly on his knee. You justcant convict a man on evidence like thatyou cant.

You couldnt, but they could and did. The older you grow the more of it youll see. Theone place where a man ought to get a square deal is in a courtroom, be he any color ofthe rainbow, but people have a way of carrying their resentments right into a jury box.

As you grow older, youll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but letme tell you something and dont you forget itwhenever a white man does that to ablack man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes from, thatwhite man is trash.

Atticus was speaking so quietly his last word crashed on our ears. I looked up, and hisface was vehement. Theres nothing more sickening to me than a low-grade white manwholl take advantage of a Negros ignorance. Dont fool yourselvesits all adding upand one of these days were going to pay the bill for it. I hope its not in you childrenstime.

Jem was scratching his head. Suddenly his eyes widened. Atticus, he said, whydont people like us and Miss Maudie ever sit on juries? You never see anybody fromMaycomb on a jurythey all come from out in the woods.

Atticus leaned back in his rocking-chair. For some reason he looked pleased withJem. I was wondering when thatd occur to you, he said. There are lots of reasons.

For one thing, Miss Maudie cant serve on a jury because shes a woman

You mean women in Alabama cant? I was indignant.

I do. I guess its to protect our frail ladies from sordid cases like Toms. Besides,

Atticus grinned, I doubt if wed ever get a complete case triedthe ladiesd beinterrupting to ask questions.

Jem and I laughed. Miss Maudie on a jury would be impressive. I thought of old Mrs.

Dubose in her wheelchairStop that rapping, John Taylor, I want to ask this mansomething. Perhaps our forefathers were wise.

Atticus was saying, With people like usthats our share of the bill. We generally getthe juries we deserve. Our stout Maycomb citizens arent interested, in the first place. Inthe second place, theyre afraid. Then, theyre

Afraid, why? asked Jem.

Well, what ifsay, Mr. Link Deas had to decide the amount of damages to award,say, Miss Maudie, when Miss Rachel ran over her with a car. Link wouldnt like thethought of losing either ladys business at his store, would he? So he tells Judge Taylorthat he cant serve on the jury because he doesnt have anybody to keep store for himwhile hes gone. So Judge Taylor excuses him. Sometimes he excuses him wrathfully.

Whatd make him think either one of emd stop trading with him? I asked.

Jem said, Miss Rachel would, Miss Maudie wouldnt. But a jurys votes secret,Atticus.

Our father chuckled. Youve many more miles to go, son. A jurys votes supposed tobe secret. Serving on a jury forces a man to make up his mind and declare himselfabout something. Men dont like to do that. Sometimes its unpleasant.

Toms jury sho made up its mind in a hurry, Jem muttered.

Atticuss fingers went to his watchpocket. No it didnt, he said, more to himself thanto us. That was the one thing that made me think, well, this may be the shadow of abeginning. That jury took a few hours. An inevitable verdict, maybe, but usually it takesem just a few minutes. This time he broke off and looked at us. You might like toknow that there was one fellow who took considerable wearing downin the beginninghe was rarin for an outright acquittal.

Who? Jem was astonished.

Atticuss eyes twinkled. Its not for me to say, but Ill tell you this much. He was one ofyour Old Sarum friends

One of the Cunninghams? Jem yelped. One ofI didnt recognize any of emyoure jokin. He looked at Atticus from the corners of his eyes.

One of their connections. On a hunch, I didnt strike him. Just on a hunch. Couldve,but I didnt.

Golly Moses, Jem said reverently. One minute theyre tryin to kill him and the nexttheyre tryin to turn him loose Ill never understand those folks as long as I live.

Atticus said you just had to know em. He said the Cunninghams hadnt taken anythingfrom or off of anybody since they migrated to the New World. He said the other thingabout them was, once you earned their respect they were for you tooth and nail. Atticussaid he had a feeling, nothing more than a suspicion, that they left the jail that night withconsiderable respect for the Finches. Then too, he said, it took a thunderbolt plusanother Cunningham to make one of them change his mind. If wed had two of thatcrowd, wedve had a hung jury.

Jem said slowly, You mean you actually put on the jury a man who wanted to kill youthe night before? How could you take such a risk, Atticus, how could you?

When you analyze it, there was little risk. Theres no difference between one manwhos going to convict and another man whos going to convict, is there? Theres a faintdifference between a man whos going to convict and a man whos a little disturbed inhis mind, isnt there? He was the only uncertainty on the whole list.

What kin was that man to Mr. Walter Cunningham? I asked.

Atticus rose, stretched and yawned. It was not even our bedtime, but we knew hewanted a chance to read his newspaper. He picked it up, folded it, and tapped my head.

Lets see now, he droned to himself. Ive got it. Double first cousin.

How can that be?

Two sisters married two brothers. Thats all Ill tell youyou figure it out.

I tortured myself and decided that if I married Jem and Dill had a sister whom hemarried our children would be double first cousins. Gee minetti, Jem, I said, whenAtticus had gone, theyre funny folks. d you hear that, Aunty?

Aunt Alexandra was hooking a rug and not watching us, but she was listening. She satin her chair with her workbasket beside it, her rug spread across her lap. Why ladieshooked woolen rugs on boiling nights never became clear to me.

I heard it, she said.

I remembered the distant disastrous occasion when I rushed to young WalterCunninghams defense. Now I was glad Id done it. Soons school starts Im gonna askWalter home to dinner, I planned, having forgotten my private resolve to beat him upthe next time I saw him. He can stay over sometimes after school, too. Atticus coulddrive him back to Old Sarum. Maybe he could spend the night with us sometime, okay,Jem?

Well see about that, Aunt Alexandra said, a declaration that with her was always athreat, never a promise. Surprised, I turned to her. Why not, Aunty? Theyre goodfolks.

She looked at me over her sewing glasses. Jean Louise, there is no doubt in my mindthat theyre good folks. But theyre not our kind of folks.

Jem says, She means theyre yappy, Scout.

Whats a yap?

Aw, tacky. They like fiddlin and things like that.

Well I do too

Dont be silly, Jean Louise, said Aunt Alexandra. The thing is, you can scrub WalterCunningham till he shines, you can put him in shoes and a new suit, but hell never belike Jem. Besides, theres a drinking streak in that family a mile wide. Finch womenarent interested in that sort of people.

Aun-ty, said Jem, she aint nine yet.

She may as well learn it now.

Aunt Alexandra had spoken. I was reminded vividly of the last time she had put herfoot down. I never knew why. It was when I was absorbed with plans to visit CalpurniashouseI was curious, interested; I wanted to be her company, to see how she lived,who her friends were. I might as well have wanted to see the other side of the moon.

This time the tactics were different, but Aunt Alexandras aim was the same. Perhapsthis was why she had come to live with usto help us choose our friends. I would holdher off as long as I could: If theyre good folks, then why cant I be nice to Walter?

I didnt say not to be nice to him. You should be friendly and polite to him, you shouldbe gracious to everybody, dear. But you dont have to invite him home.

What if he was kin to us, Aunty?

The fact is that he is not kin to us, but if he were, my answer would be the same.

Aunty, Jem spoke up, Atticus says you can choose your friends but you sho cantchoose your family, an theyre still kin to you no matter whether you acknowledge emor not, and it makes you look right silly when you dont.

Thats your father all over again, said Aunt Alexandra, and I still say that JeanLouise will not invite Walter Cunningham to this house. If he were her double first cousinonce removed he would still not be received in this house unless he comes to seeAtticus on business. Now that is that.

She had said Indeed Not, but this time she would give her reasons: But I want to playwith Walter, Aunty, why cant I?

She took off her glasses and stared at me. Ill tell you why, she said. Becauseheistrash, thats why you cant play with him. Ill not have you around him, pickingup his habits and learning Lord-knows-what. Youre enough of a problem to your fatheras it is.

I dont know what I would have done, but Jem stopped me. He caught me by theshoulders, put his arm around me, and led me sobbing in fury to his bedroom. Atticusheard us and poked his head around the door. s all right, sir, Jem said gruffly, s notanything. Atticus went away.

Have a chew, Scout. Jem dug into his pocket and extracted a Tootsie Roll. It took afew minutes to work the candy into a comfortable wad inside my jaw.

Jem was rearranging the objects on his dresser. His hair stuck up behind and down infront, and I wondered if it would ever look like a mansmaybe if he shaved it off andstarted over, his hair would grow back neatly in place. His eyebrows were becomingheavier, and I noticed a new slimness about his body. He was growing taller. When helooked around, he must have thought I would start crying again, for he said, Show yousomething if you wont tell anybody. I said what. He unbuttoned his shirt, grinning shyly.

Well what?

Well cant you see it?

Well no.

Well its hair.

Where?

There. Right there.

He had been a comfort to me, so I said it looked lovely, but I didnt see anything. Itsreal nice, Jem.

Under my arms, too, he said. Goin out for football next year. Scout, dont let Auntyaggravate you.

It seemed only yesterday that he was telling me not to aggravate Aunty.

You know shes not used to girls, said Jem, leastways, not girls like you. Shestrying to make you a lady. Cant you take up sewin or somethin?

Hell no. She doesnt like me, thats all there is to it, and I dont care. It was her callinWalter Cunningham trash that got me goin, Jem, not what she said about being aproblem to Atticus. We got that all straight one time, I asked him if I was a problem andhe said not much of one, at most one that he could always figure out, and not to worrymy head a second about botherin him. Naw, it was Walterthat boys not trash, Jem.

He aint like the Ewells.

Jem kicked off his shoes and swung his feet to the bed. He propped himself against apillow and switched on the reading light. You know something, Scout? Ive got it allfigured out, now. Ive thought about it a lot lately and Ive got it figured out. Theres fourkinds of folks in the world. Theres the ordinary kind like us and the neighbors, theresthe kind like the Cunninghams out in the woods, the kind like the Ewells down at thedump, and the Negroes.

What about the Chinese, and the Cajuns down yonder in Baldwin County?

I mean in Maycomb County. The thing about it is, our kind of folks dont like theCunninghams, the Cunninghams dont like the Ewells, and the Ewells hate and despisethe colored folks.

I told Jem if that was so, then why didnt Toms jury, made up of folks like theCunninghams, acquit Tom to spite the Ewells?Jem waved my question away as being infantile.

You know, he said, Ive seen Atticus pat his foot when theres fiddlin on the radio,and he loves pot liquor bettern any man I ever saw

Then that makes us like the Cunninghams, I said. I cant see why Aunty

No, lemme finishit does, but were still different somehow. Atticus said one time thereason Auntys so hipped on the family is because all weve gots background and not adime to our names.

Well Jem, I dont knowAtticus told me one time that most of this Old Family stuffsfoolishness because everybodys familys just as old as everybody elses. I said did thatinclude the colored folks and Englishmen and he said yes.

Background doesnt mean Old Family, said Jem. I think its how long your familysbeen readin and writin. Scout, Ive studied this real hard and thats the only reason Ican think of. Somewhere along when the Finches were in Egypt one of em must havelearned a hieroglyphic or two and he taught his boy. Jem laughed. Imagine Auntybeing proud her great-grandaddy could read an writeladies pick funny things to beproud of.

Well Im glad he could, or whoda taught Atticus and them, and if Atticus couldntread, you and med be in a fix. I dont think thats what background is, Jem.

Well then, how do you explain why the Cunninghams are different? Mr. Walter canhardly sign his name, Ive seen him. Weve just been readin and writin longern theyhave.

No, everybodys gotta learn, nobodys born knowin. That Walters as smart as he canbe, he just gets held back sometimes because he has to stay out and help his daddy.

Nothins wrong with him. Naw, Jem, I think theres just one kind of folks. Folks.

Jem turned around and punched his pillow. When he settled back his face was cloudy.

He was going into one of his declines, and I grew wary. His brows came together; hismouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while.

Thats what I thought, too, he said at last, when I was your age. If theres just onekind of folks, why cant they get along with each other? If theyre all alike, why do theygo out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think Im beginning to understandsomething. I think Im beginning to understand why Boo Radleys stayed shut up in thehouse all this time its because he wants to stay inside.

Chapter 24

Calpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron. She carried a tray of charlotte. She backedup to the swinging door and pressed gently. I admired the ease and grace with whichshe handled heavy loads of dainty things. So did Aunt Alexandra, I guess, because shehad let Calpurnia serve today.

August was on the brink of September. Dill would be leaving for Meridian tomorrow;today he was off with Jem at Barkers Eddy. Jem had discovered with angry amazementthat nobody had ever bothered to teach Dill how to swim, a skill Jem considerednecessary as walking. They had spent two afternoons at the creek, they said they weregoing in naked and I couldnt come, so I divided the lonely hours between Calpurnia andMiss Maudie.

Today Aunt Alexandra and her missionary circle were fighting the good fight all overthe house. From the kitchen, I heard Mrs. Grace Merriweather giving a report in thelivingroom on the squalid lives of the Mrunas, it sounded like to me. They put the womenout in huts when their time came, whatever that was; they had no sense of familyIknew thatd distress Auntythey subjected children to terrible ordeals when they werethirteen; they were crawling with yaws and earworms, they chewed up and spat out thebark of a tree into a communal pot and then got drunk on it.

Immediately thereafter, the ladies adjourned for refreshments.

I didnt know whether to go into the diningroom or stay out. Aunt Alexandra told me tojoin them for refreshments; it was not necessary that I attend the business part of themeeting, she said itd bore me. I was wearing my pink Sunday dress, shoes, and apetticoat, and reflected that if I spilled anything Calpurnia would have to wash my dressagain for tomorrow. This had been a busy day for her. I decided to stay out.

Can I help you, Cal? I asked, wishing to be of some service.

Calpurnia paused in the doorway. You be still as a mouse in that corner, she said,an you can help me load up the trays when I come back.

The gentle hum of ladies voices grew louder as she opened the door: Why,Alexandra, I never saw such charlotte just lovely I never can get my crust like this,never can whodve thought of little dewberry tarts Calpurnia? whoda thought itanybody tell you that the preachers wifes nooo, well she is, and that other one notwalkin yet

They became quiet, and I knew they had all been served. Calpurnia returned and putmy mothers heavy silver pitcher on a tray. This coffee pitchers a curiosity, shemurmured, they dont make em these days.

Can I carry it in?

If you be careful and dont drop it. Set it down at the end of the table by MissAlexandra. Down there by the cupsn things. Shes gonna pour.

I tried pressing my behind against the door as Calpurnia had done, but the door didntbudge. Grinning, she held it open for me. Careful now, its heavy. Dont look at it andyou wont spill it.

My journey was successful: Aunt Alexandra smiled brilliantly. Stay with us, JeanLouise, she said. This was a part of her campaign to teach me to be a lady.

It was customary for every circle hostess to invite her neighbors in for refreshments,be they Baptists or Presbyterians, which accounted for the presence of Miss Rachel(sober as a judge), Miss Maudie and Miss Stephanie Crawford. Rather nervous, I took aseat beside Miss Maudie and wondered why ladies put on their hats to go across thestreet. Ladies in bunches always filled me with vague apprehension and a firm desire tobe elsewhere, but this feeling was what Aunt Alexandra called being spoiled.

The ladies were cool in fragile pastel prints: most of them were heavily powdered butunrouged; the only lipstick in the room was Tangee Natural. Cutex Natural sparkled ontheir fingernails, but some of the younger ladies wore Rose. They smelled heavenly. Isat quietly, having conquered my hands by tightly gripping the arms of the chair, andwaited for someone to speak to me.

Miss Maudies gold bridgework twinkled. Youre mighty dressed up, Miss JeanLouise, she said, Where are your britches today?

Under my dress.

I hadnt meant to be funny, but the ladies laughed. My cheeks grew hot as I realizedmy mistake, but Miss Maudie looked gravely down at me. She never laughed at meunless I meant to be funny.

In the sudden silence that followed, Miss Stephanie Crawford called from across theroom, Whatcha going to be when you grow up, Jean Louise? A lawyer?

Nome, I hadnt thought about it I answered, grateful that Miss Stephanie was kindenough to change the subject. Hurriedly I began choosing my vocation. Nurse? Aviator?

Well

Why shoot, I thought you wanted to be a lawyer, youve already commenced going tocourt.

The ladies laughed again. That Stephanies a card, somebody said. Miss Stephaniewas encouraged to pursue the subject: Dont you want to grow up to be a lawyer?

Miss Maudies hand touched mine and I answered mildly enough, Nome, just a lady.

Miss Stephanie eyed me suspiciously, decided that I meant no impertinence, andcontented herself with, Well, you wont get very far until you start wearing dresses moreoften.

Miss Maudies hand closed tightly on mine, and I said nothing. Its warmth wasenough.

Mrs. Grace Merriweather sat on my left, and I felt it would be polite to talk to her. Mr.

Merriweather, a faithful Methodist under duress, apparently saw nothing personal insinging, Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me It wasthe general opinion of Maycomb, however, that Mrs. Merriweather had sobered him upand made a reasonably useful citizen of him. For certainly Mrs. Merriweather was themost devout lady in Maycomb. I searched for a topic of interest to her. What did you allstudy this afternoon? I asked.

Oh child, those poor Mrunas, she said, and was off. Few other questions would benecessary.

Mrs. Merriweathers large brown eyes always filled with tears when she consideredthe oppressed. Living in that jungle with nobody but J. Grimes Everett, she said. Not awhite personll go near em but that saintly J. Grimes Everett.

Mrs. Merriweather played her voice like an organ; every word she said received its fullmeasure: The poverty the darkness the immoralitynobody but J. Grimes Everettknows. You know, when the church gave me that trip to the camp grounds J. GrimesEverett said to me

Was he there, maam? I thought

Home on leave. J. Grimes Everett said to me, he said, Mrs. Merriweather, you haveno conception, no conception of what we are fighting over there. Thats what he said tome.

Yes maam.

I said to him, Mr. Everett, I said, the ladies of the Maycomb Alabama MethodistEpiscopal Church South are behind you one hundred percent. Thats what I said to him.

And you know, right then and there I made a pledge in my heart. I said to myself, when Igo home Im going to give a course on the Mrunas and bring J. Grimes Everettsmessage to Maycomb and thats just what Im doing.

Yes maam.

When Mrs. Merriweather shook her head, her black curls jiggled. Jean Louise, shesaid, you are a fortunate girl. You live in a Christian home with Christian folks in aChristian town. Out there in J. Grimes Everetts land theres nothing but sin andsqualor.

Yes maam.

Sin and squalorwhat was that, Gertrude? Mrs. Merriweather turned on her chimesfor the lady sitting beside her. Oh that. Well, I always say forgive and forget, forgive andforget. Thing that church ought to do is help her lead a Christian life for those childrenfrom here on out. Some of the men ought to go out there and tell that preacher toencourage her.

Excuse me, Mrs. Merriweather, I interrupted, are you all talking about MayellaEwell?

May? No, child. That darkys wife. Toms wife, Tom

Robinson, maam.

Mrs. Merriweather turned back to her neighbor. Theres one thing I truly believe,Gertrude, she continued, but some people just dont see it my way. If we just let themknow we forgive em, that weve forgotten it, then this whole thingll blow over.

AhMrs. Merriweather, I interrupted once more, whatll blow over?

Again, she turned to me. Mrs. Merriweather was one of those childless adults who findit necessary to assume a different tone of voice when speaking to children. Nothing,Jean Louise, she said, in stately largo, the cooks and field hands are just dissatisfied,but theyre settling down nowthey grumbled all next day after that trial.

Mrs. Merriweather faced Mrs. Farrow: Gertrude, I tell you theres nothing moredistracting than a sulky darky. Their mouths go down to here. Just ruins your day tohave one of em in the kitchen. You know what I said to my Sophy, Gertrude? I said,Sophy, I said, you simply are not being a Christian today. Jesus Christ never wentaround grumbling and complaining, and you know, it did her good. She took her eyesoff that floor and said, Nome, Miz Merriweather, Jesus never went around grumblin. Itell you, Gertrude, you never ought to let an opportunity go by to witness for the Lord.

I was reminded of the ancient little organ in the chapel at Finchs Landing. When I wasvery small, and if I had been very good during the day, Atticus would let me pump itsbellows while he picked out a tune with one finger. The last note would linger as long asthere was air to sustain it. Mrs. Merriweather had run out of air, I judged, and wasreplenishing her supply while Mrs. Farrow composed herself to speak.

Mrs. Farrow was a splendidly built woman with pale eyes and narrow feet. She had afresh permanent wave, and her hair was a mass of tight gray ringlets. She was thesecond most devout lady in Maycomb. She had a curious habit of prefacing everythingshe said with a soft sibilant sound.

S-s-s Grace, she said, its just like I was telling Brother Hutson the other day. S-s-sBrother Hutson, I said, looks like were fighting a losing battle, a losing battle. I said, S-s-s it doesnt matter to em one bit. We can educate em till were blue in the face, wecan try till we drop to make Christians out of em, but theres no lady safe in her bedthese nights. He said to me, Mrs. Farrow, I dont know what were coming to downhere. S-s-s I told him that was certainly a fact.

Mrs. Merriweather nodded wisely. Her voice soared over the clink of coffee cups andthe soft bovine sounds of the ladies munching their dainties. Gertrude, she said, I tellyou there are some good but misguided people in this town. Good, but misguided. Folksin this town who think theyre doing right, I mean. Now far be it from me to say who, butsome of em in this town thought they were doing the right thing a while back, but allthey did was stir em up. Thats all they did. Mightve looked like the right thing to do atthe time, Im sure I dont know, Im not read in that field, but sulky dissatisfied I tellyou if my Sophyd kept it up another day Id have let her go. Its never entered that woolof hers that the only reason I keep her is because this depressions on and she needsher dollar and a quarter every week she can get it.

His food doesnt stick going down, does it?

Miss Maudie said it. Two tight lines had appeared at the corners of her mouth. Shehad been sitting silently beside me, her coffee cup balanced on one knee. I had lost thethread of conversation long ago, when they quit talking about Tom Robinsons wife, andhad contented myself with thinking of Finchs Landing and the river. Aunt Alexandra hadgot it backwards: the business part of the meeting was blood-curdling, the social hourwas dreary.

Maudie, Im sure I dont know what you mean, said Mrs. Merriweather.

Im sure you do, Miss Maudie said shortly.

She said no more. When Miss Maudie was angry her brevity was icy. Something hadmade her deeply angry, and her gray eyes were as cold as her voice. Mrs. Merriweatherreddened, glanced at me, and looked away. I could not see Mrs. Farrow.

Aunt Alexandra got up from the table and swiftly passed more refreshments, neatlyengaging Mrs. Merriweather and Mrs. Gates in brisk conversation. When she had themwell on the road with Mrs. Perkins, Aunt Alexandra stepped back. She gave MissMaudie a look of pure gratitude, and I wondered at the world of women. Miss Maudieand Aunt Alexandra had never been especially close, and here was Aunty silentlythanking her for something. For what, I knew not. I was content to learn that AuntAlexandra could be pierced sufficiently to feel gratitude for help given. There was nodoubt about it, I must soon enter this world, where on its surface fragrant ladies rockedslowly, fanned gently, and drank cool water.

But I was more at home in my fathers world. People like Mr. Heck Tate did not trapyou with innocent questions to make fun of you; even Jem was not highly critical unlessyou said something stupid. Ladies seemed to live in faint horror of men, seemedunwilling to approve wholeheartedly of them. But I liked them. There was somethingabout them, no matter how much they cussed and drank and gambled and chewed; nomatter how undelectable they were, there was something about them that I instinctivelyliked they werentHypocrites, Mrs. Perkins, born hypocrites, Mrs. Merriweather was saying. At leastwe dont have that sin on our shoulders down here. People up there set em free, butyou dont see em settin at the table with em. At least we dont have the deceit to say toem yes youre as good as we are but stay away from us. Down here we just say youlive your way and well live ours. I think that woman, that Mrs. Roosevelts lost hermindjust plain lost her mind coming down to Birmingham and tryin to sit with em. If Iwas the Mayor of Birmingham Id

Well, neither of us was the Mayor of Birmingham, but I wished I was the Governor ofAlabama for one day: Id let Tom Robinson go so quick the Missionary Society wouldnthave time to catch its breath. Calpurnia was telling Miss Rachels cook the other dayhow bad Tom was taking things and she didnt stop talking when I came into the kitchen.

She said there wasnt a thing Atticus could do to make being shut up easier for him, thatthe last thing he said to Atticus before they took him down to the prison camp was,Good-bye, Mr. Finch, there aint nothin you can do now, so there aint no use tryin.

Calpurnia said Atticus told her that the day they took Tom to prison he just gave uphope. She said Atticus tried to explain things to him, and that he must do his best not tolose hope because Atticus was doing his best to get him free. Miss Rachels cook askedCalpurnia why didnt Atticus just say yes, youll go free, and leave it at thatseemed likethatd be a big comfort to Tom. Calpurnia said, Because you aint familiar with the law.

First thing you learn when youre in a lawin family is that there aint any definite answersto anything. Mr. Finch couldnt say somethins so when he doesnt know for sure its so.

The front door slammed and I heard Atticuss footsteps in the hall. Automatically Iwondered what time it was. Not nearly time for him to be home, and on MissionarySociety days he usually stayed downtown until black dark.

He stopped in the doorway. His hat was in his hand, and his face was white.

Excuse me, ladies, he said. Go right ahead with your meeting, dont let me disturbyou. Alexandra, could you come to the kitchen a minute? I want to borrow Calpurnia fora while.

He didnt go through the diningroom, but went down the back hallway and entered thekitchen from the rear door. Aunt Alexandra and I met him. The diningroom door openedagain and Miss Maudie joined us. Calpurnia had half risen from her chair.

Cal, Atticus said, I want you to go with me out to Helen Robinsons house

Whats the matter? Aunt Alexandra asked, alarmed by the look on my fathers face.

Toms dead.

Aunt Alexandra put her hands to her mouth.

They shot him, said Atticus. He was running. It was during their exercise period.

They said he just broke into a blind raving charge at the fence and started climbing over.

Right in front of them

Didnt they try to stop him? Didnt they give him any warning? Aunt Alexandras voiceshook.

Oh yes, the guards called to him to stop. They fired a few shots in the air, then to kill.

They got him just as he went over the fence. They said if hed had two good arms hedhave made it, he was moving that fast. Seventeen bullet holes in him. They didnt haveto shoot him that much. Cal, I want you to come out with me and help me tell Helen.

Yes sir, she murmured, fumbling at her apron. Miss Maudie went to Calpurnia anduntied it.

This is the last straw, Atticus, Aunt Alexandra said.

Depends on how you look at it, he said. What was one Negro, more or less, amongtwo hundred of em? He wasnt Tom to them, he was an escaping prisoner.

Atticus leaned against the refrigerator, pushed up his glasses, and rubbed his eyes.

We had such a good chance, he said. I told him what I thought, but I couldnt in truthsay that we had more than a good chance. I guess Tom was tired of white menschances and preferred to take his own. Ready, Cal?

Yessir, Mr. Finch.

Then lets go.

Aunt Alexandra sat down in Calpurnias chair and put her hands to her face. She satquite still; she was so quiet I wondered if she would faint. I heard Miss Maudie breathingas if she had just climbed the steps, and in the diningroom the ladies chattered happily.

I thought Aunt Alexandra was crying, but when she took her hands away from herface, she was not. She looked weary. She spoke, and her voice was flat.

I cant say I approve of everything he does, Maudie, but hes my brother, and I justwant to know when this will ever end. Her voice rose: It tears him to pieces. He doesntshow it much, but it tears him to pieces. Ive seen him whenwhat else do they wantfrom him, Maudie, what else?

What does who want, Alexandra? Miss Maudie asked.

I mean this town. Theyre perfectly willing to let him do what theyre too afraid to dothemselvesit might lose em a nickel. Theyre perfectly willing to let him wreck hishealth doing what theyre afraid to do, theyre

Be quiet, theyll hear you, said Miss Maudie. Have you ever thought of it this way,Alexandra? Whether Maycomb knows it or not, were paying the highest tribute we canpay a man. We trust him to do right. Its that simple.

Who? Aunt Alexandra never knew she was echoing her twelve-year-old nephew.

The handful of people in this town who say that fair play is not marked White Only;the handful of people who say a fair trial is for everybody, not just us; the handful ofpeople with enough humility to think, when they look at a Negro, there but for the Lordskindness am l. Miss Maudies old crispness was returning: The handful of people inthis town with background, thats who they are.

Had I been attentive, I would have had another scrap to add to Jems definition ofbackground, but I found myself shaking and couldnt stop. I had seen Enfield PrisonFarm, and Atticus had pointed out the exercise yard to me. It was the size of a footballfield.

Stop that shaking, commanded Miss Maudie, and I stopped. Get up, Alexandra,weve left em long enough.

Aunt Alexandra rose and smoothed the various whalebone ridges along her hips. Shetook her handkerchief from her belt and wiped her nose. She patted her hair and said,Do I show it?

Not a sign, said Miss Maudie. Are you together again, Jean Louise?

Yes maam.

Then lets join the ladies, she said grimly.

Their voices swelled when Miss Maudie opened the door to the diningroom. AuntAlexandra was ahead of me, and I saw her head go up as she went through the door.

Oh, Mrs. Perkins, she said, you need some more coffee. Let me get it.

Calpurnias on an errand for a few minutes, Grace, said Miss Maudie. Let me passyou some more of those dewberry tarts. dyou hear what that cousin of mine did theother day, the one who likes to go fishing?

And so they went, down the row of laughing women, around the diningroom, refillingcoffee cups, dishing out goodies as though their only regret was the temporary domesticdisaster of losing Calpurnia. The gentle hum began again. Yes sir, Mrs. Perkins, that J.

Grimes Everett is a martyred saint, he needed to get married so they ran to thebeauty parlor every Saturday afternoon soon as the sun goes down. He goes to bedwith the chickens, a crate full of sick chickens, Fred says thats what started it all. Fredsays

Aunt Alexandra looked across the room at me and smiled. She looked at a tray ofcookies on the table and nodded at them. I carefully picked up the tray and watchedmyself walk to Mrs. Merriweather. With my best company manners, I asked her if shewould have some.

After all, if Aunty could be a lady at a time like this, so could I.


Chapter 25

Dont do that, Scout. Set him out on the back steps.

Jem, are you crazy?

I said set him out on the back steps.

Sighing, I scooped up the small creature, placed him on the bottom step and wentback to my cot. September had come, but not a trace of cool weather with it, and wewere still sleeping on the back screen porch. Lightning bugs were still about, the nightcrawlers and flying insects that beat against the screen the summer long had not gonewherever they go when autumn comes.

A roly-poly had found his way inside the house; I reasoned that the tiny varmint hadcrawled up the steps and under the door. I was putting my book on the floor beside mycot when I saw him. The creatures are no more than an inch long, and when you touchthem they roll themselves into a tight gray ball.

I lay on my stomach, reached down and poked him. He rolled up. Then, feeling safe, Isuppose, he slowly unrolled. He traveled a few inches on his hundred legs and Itouched him again. He rolled up. Feeling sleepy, I decided to end things. My hand wasgoing down on him when Jem spoke.

Jem was scowling. It was probably a part of the stage he was going through, and Iwished he would hurry up and get through it. He was certainly never cruel to animals,but I had never known his charity to embrace the insect world.

Why couldnt I mash him? I asked.

Because they dont bother you, Jem answered in the darkness. He had turned outhis reading light.

Reckon youre at the stage now where you dont kill flies and mosquitoes now, Ireckon, I said. Lemme know when you change your mind. Tell you one thing, though, Iaint gonna sit around and not scratch a redbug.

Aw dry up, he answered drowsily.

Jem was the one who was getting more like a girl every day, not I. Comfortable, I layon my back and waited for sleep, and while waiting I thought of Dill. He had left us thefirst of the month with firm assurances that he would return the minute school was outhe guessed his folks had got the general idea that he liked to spend his summers inMaycomb. Miss Rachel took us with them in the taxi to Maycomb Junction, and Dillwaved to us from the train window until he was out of sight. He was not out of mind: Imissed him. The last two days of his time with us, Jem had taught him to swimTaught him to swim. I was wide awake, remembering what Dill had told me.

Barkers Eddy is at the end of a dirt road off the Meridian highway about a mile fromtown. It is easy to catch a ride down the highway on a cotton wagon or from a passingmotorist, and the short walk to the creek is easy, but the prospect of walking all the wayback home at dusk, when the traffic is light, is tiresome, and swimmers are careful not tostay too late.

According to Dill, he and Jem had just come to the highway when they saw Atticusdriving toward them. He looked like he had not seen them, so they both waved. Atticusfinally slowed down; when they caught up with him he said, Youd better catch a rideback. I wont be going home for a while. Calpurnia was in the back seat. Jem protested,then pleaded, and Atticus said, All right, you can come with us if you stay in the car.

On the way to Tom Robinsons, Atticus told them what had happened.

They turned off the highway, rode slowly by the dump and past the Ewell residence,down the narrow lane to the Negro cabins. Dill said a crowd of black children wereplaying marbles in Toms front yard. Atticus parked the car and got out. Calpurniafollowed him through the front gate.

Dill heard him ask one of the children, Wheres your mother, Sam? and heard Samsay, She down at Sis Stevenss, Mr. Finch. Want me run fetch her?

Dill said Atticus looked uncertain, then he said yes, and Sam scampered off. Go onwith your game, boys, Atticus said to the children.

A little girl came to the cabin door and stood looking at Atticus. Dill said her hair was awad of tiny stiff pigtails, each ending in a bright bow. She grinned from ear to ear andwalked toward our father, but she was too small to navigate the steps. Dill said Atticuswent to her, took off his hat, and offered her his finger. She grabbed it and he eased herdown the steps. Then he gave her to Calpurnia.

Sam was trotting behind his mother when they came up. Dill said Helen said, evenin,Mr. Finch, wont you have a seat? But she didnt say any more. Neither did Atticus.

Scout, said Dill, she just fell down in the dirt. Just fell down in the dirt, like a giantwith a big foot just came along and stepped on her. Just ump Dills fat foot hit theground. Like youd step on an ant.

Dill said Calpurnia and Atticus lifted Helen to her feet and half carried, half walked herto the cabin. They stayed inside a long time, and Atticus came out alone. When theydrove back by the dump, some of the Ewells hollered at them, but Dill didnt catch whatthey said.

Maycomb was interested by the news of Toms death for perhaps two days; two dayswas enough for the information to spread through the county. Did you hear about?No? Well, they say he was runnin fit to beat lightnin To Maycomb, Toms death wastypical. Typical of a nigger to cut and run. Typical of a niggers mentality to have no plan,no thought for the future, just run blind first chance he saw. Funny thing, Atticus Finchmightve got him off scot free, but wait? Hell no. You know how they are. Easy come,easy go. Just shows you, that Robinson boy was legally married, they say he kepthimself clean, went to church and all that, but when it comes down to the line theveneers mighty thin. Nigger always comes out in em.

A few more details, enabling the listener to repeat his version in turn, then nothing totalk about until The Maycomb Tribune appeared the following Thursday. There was abrief obituary in the Colored News, but there was also an editorial.

Mr. B. B. Underwood was at his most bitter, and he couldnt have cared less whocanceled advertising and subscriptions. (But Maycomb didnt play that way: Mr.

Underwood could holler till he sweated and write whatever he wanted to, hed still gethis advertising and subscriptions. If he wanted to make a fool of himself in his paper thatwas his business.) Mr. Underwood didnt talk about miscarriages of justice, he waswriting so children could understand. Mr. Underwood simply figured it was a sin to killcripples, be they standing, sitting, or escaping. He likened Toms death to the senselessslaughter of songbirds by hunters and children, and Maycomb thought he was trying towrite an editorial poetical enough to be reprinted in The Montgomery Advertiser.

How could this be so, I wondered, as I read Mr. Underwoods editorial. SenselesskillingTom had been given due process of law to the day of his death; he had beentried openly and convicted by twelve good men and true; my father had fought for him allthe way. Then Mr. Underwoods meaning became clear: Atticus had used every toolavailable to free men to save Tom Robinson, but in the secret courts of mens heartsAtticus had no case. Tom was a dead man the minute Mayella Ewell opened her mouthand screamed.

The name Ewell gave me a queasy feeling. Maycomb had lost no time in getting Mr.

Ewells views on Toms demise and passing them along through that English Channel ofgossip, Miss Stephanie Crawford. Miss Stephanie told Aunt Alexandra in Jemspresence (Oh foot, hes old enough to listen.) that Mr. Ewell said it made one downand about two more to go. Jem told me not to be afraid, Mr. Ewell was more hot gasthan anything. Jem also told me that if I breathed a word to Atticus, if in any way I letAtticus know I knew, Jem would personally never speak to me again.


Chapter 26

School started, and so did our daily trips past the Radley Place. Jem was in theseventh grade and went to high school, beyond the grammar-school building; I was nowin the third grade, and our routines were so different I only walked to school with Jem inthe mornings and saw him at mealtimes. He went out for football, but was too slenderand too young yet to do anything but carry the team water buckets. This he did withenthusiasm; most afternoons he was seldom home before dark.

The Radley Place had ceased to terrify me, but it was no less gloomy, no less chillyunder its great oaks, and no less uninviting. Mr. Nathan Radley could still be seen on aclear day, walking to and from town; we knew Boo was there, for the same old reasonnobodyd seen him carried out yet. I sometimes felt a twinge of remorse, when passingby the old place, at ever having taken part in what must have been sheer torment toArthur Radleywhat reasonable recluse wants children peeping through his shutters,delivering greetings on the end of a fishing-pole, wandering in his collards at night? Andyet I remembered. Two Indian-head pennies, chewing gum, soap dolls, a rusty medal, abroken watch and chain. Jem must have put them away somewhere. I stopped andlooked at the tree one afternoon: the trunk was swelling around its cement patch. Thepatch itself was turning yellow.

We had almost seen him a couple of times, a good enough score for anybody.

But I still looked for him each time I went by. Maybe someday we would see him. Iimagined how it would be: when it happened, hed just be sitting in the swing when Icame along. Hidy do, Mr. Arthur, I would say, as if I had said it every afternoon of mylife. Evening, Jean Louise, he would say, as if he had said it every afternoon of my life,right pretty spell were having, isnt it? Yes sir, right pretty, I would say, and go on.

It was only a fantasy. We would never see him. He probably did go out when themoon was down and gaze upon Miss Stephanie Crawford. Id have picked somebodyelse to look at, but that was his business. He would never gaze at us.

You arent starting that again, are you? said Atticus one night, when I expressed astray desire just to have one good look at Boo Radley before I died. If you are, Ill tellyou right now: stop it. Im too old to go chasing you off the Radley property. Besides, itsdangerous. You might get shot. You know Mr. Nathan shoots at every shadow he sees,even shadows that leave size-four bare footprints. You were lucky not to be killed.

I hushed then and there. At the same time I marveled at Atticus. This was the first hehad let us know he knew a lot more about something than we thought he knew. And ithad happened years ago. No, only last summerno, summer before last, when timewas playing tricks on me. I must remember to ask Jem.

So many things had happened to us, Boo Radley was the least of our fears. Atticussaid he didnt see how anything else could happen, that things had a way of settlingdown, and after enough time passed people would forget that Tom Robinsonsexistence was ever brought to their attention.

Perhaps Atticus was right, but the events of the summer hung over us like smoke in aclosed room. The adults in Maycomb never discussed the case with Jem and me; itseemed that they discussed it with their children, and their attitude must have been thatneither of us could help having Atticus for a parent, so their children must be nice to usin spite of him. The children would never have thought that up for themselves: had ourclassmates been left to their own devices, Jem and I would have had several swift,satisfying fist-fights apiece and ended the matter for good. As it was, we were compelledto hold our heads high and be, respectively, a gentleman and a lady. In a way, it waslike the era of Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose, without all her yelling. There was one oddthing, though, that I never understood: in spite of Atticuss shortcomings as a parent,people were content to re-elect him to the state legislature that year, as usual, withoutopposition. I came to the conclusion that people were just peculiar, I withdrew fromthem, and never thought about them until I was forced to.

I was forced to one day in school. Once a week, we had a Current Events period.

Each child was supposed to clip an item from a newspaper, absorb its contents, andreveal them to the class. This practice allegedly overcame a variety of evils: standing infront of his fellows encouraged good posture and gave a child poise; delivering a shorttalk made him word-conscious; learning his current event strengthened his memory;being singled out made him more than ever anxious to return to the Group.

The idea was profound, but as usual, in Maycomb it didnt work very well. In the firstplace, few rural children had access to newspapers, so the burden of Current Eventswas borne by the town children, convincing the bus children more deeply that the townchildren got all the attention anyway. The rural children who could, usually broughtclippings from what they called The Grit Paper, a publication spurious in the eyes ofMiss Gates, our teacher. Why she frowned when a child recited from The Grit Paper Inever knew, but in some way it was associated with liking fiddling, eating syrupy biscuitsfor lunch, being a holy-roller, singing Sweetly Sings the Donkey and pronouncing itdunkey, all of which the state paid teachers to discourage.

Even so, not many of the children knew what a Current Event was. Little Chuck Little,a hundred years old in his knowledge of cows and their habits, was halfway through anUncle Natchell story when Miss Gates stopped him: Charles, that is not a current event.

That is an advertisement.

Cecil Jacobs knew what one was, though. When his turn came, he went to the front ofthe room and began, Old Hitler

Adolf Hitler, Cecil, said Miss Gates. One never begins with Old anybody.

Yes maam, he said. Old Adolf Hitler has been prosecutin the

Persecuting Cecil

Nome, Miss Gates, it says herewell anyway, old Adolf Hitler has been after theJews and hes puttin em in prisons and hes taking away all their property and he wontlet any of em out of the country and hes washin all the feeble-minded and

Washing the feeble-minded?

Yes maam, Miss Gates, I reckon they dont have sense enough to wash themselves,I dont reckon an idiot could keep hisself clean. Well anyway, Hitlers started a programto round up all the half-Jews too and he wants to register em in case they might wantacause him any trouble and I think this is a bad thing and thats my current event.

Very good, Cecil, said Miss Gates. Puffing, Cecil returned to his seat.

A hand went up in the back of the room. How can he do that?

Who do what? asked Miss Gates patiently.

I mean how can Hitler just put a lot of folks in a pen like that, looks like the govamintdstop him, said the owner of the hand.

Hitler is the government, said Miss Gates, and seizing an opportunity to makeeducation dynamic, she went to the blackboard. She printed DEMOCRACY in largeletters. Democracy, she said. Does anybody have a definition?

Us, somebody said.

I raised my hand, remembering an old campaign slogan Atticus had once told meabout.

What do you think it means, Jean Louise?

Equal rights for all, special privileges for none, I quoted.

Very good, Jean Louise, very good, Miss Gates smiled. In front of DEMOCRACY,she printed WE ARE A. Now class, say it all together, We are a democracy.

We said it. Then Miss Gates said, Thats the difference between America andGermany. We are a democracy and Germany is a dictatorship. Dictator-ship, she said.

Over here we dont believe in persecuting anybody. Persecution comes from peoplewho are prejudiced. Prejudice, she enunciated carefully. There are no better people inthe world than the Jews, and why Hitler doesnt think so is a mystery to me.

An inquiring soul in the middle of the room said, Why dont they like the Jews, youreckon, Miss Gates?

I dont know, Henry. They contribute to every society they live in, and most of all, theyare a deeply religious people. Hitlers trying to do away with religion, so maybe hedoesnt like them for that reason.

Cecil spoke up. Well I dont know for certain, he said, theyre supposed to changemoney or somethin, but that aint no cause to persecute em. Theyre white, aint they?

Miss Gates said, When you get to high school, Cecil, youll learn that the Jews havebeen persecuted since the beginning of history, even driven out of their own country. Itsone of the most terrible stories in history. Time for arithmetic, children.

As I had never liked arithmetic, I spent the period looking out the window. The onlytime I ever saw Atticus scowl was when Elmer Davis would give us the latest on Hitler.

Atticus would snap off the radio and say, Hmp! I asked him once why he was impatientwith Hitler and Atticus said, Because hes a maniac.

This would not do, I mused, as the class proceeded with its sums. One maniac andmillions of German folks. Looked to me like theyd shut Hitler in a pen instead of lettinghim shut them up. There was something else wrongI would ask my father about it.

I did, and he said he could not possibly answer my question because he didnt knowthe answer.

But its okay to hate Hitler?

It is not, he said. Its not okay to hate anybody.

Atticus, I said, theres somethin I dont understand. Miss Gates said it was awful,Hitler doin like he does, she got real red in the face about it

I should think she would.

But

Yes?

Nothing, sir. I went away, not sure that I could explain to Atticus what was on mymind, not sure that I could clarify what was only a feeling. Perhaps Jem could providethe answer. Jem understood school things better than Atticus.

Jem was worn out from a days water-carrying. There were at least twelve bananapeels on the floor by his bed, surrounding an empty milk bottle. Whatcha stuffin for? Iasked.

Coach says if I can gain twenty-five pounds by year after next I can play, he said.

This is the quickest way.

If you dont throw it all up. Jem, I said, I wanta ask you somethin.

Shoot. He put down his book and stretched his legs.

Miss Gates is a nice lady, aint she?

Why sure, said Jem. I liked her when I was in her room.

She hates Hitler a lot

Whats wrong with that?

Well, she went on today about how bad it was him treatin the Jews like that. Jem, itsnot right to persecute anybody, is it? I mean have mean thoughts about anybody, even,is it?

Gracious no, Scout. Whats eatin you?

Well, coming out of the courthouse that night Miss Gates wasshe was goin downthe steps in front of us, you musta not seen hershe was talking with Miss StephanieCrawford. I heard her say its time somebody taught em a lesson, they were gettin wayabove themselves, an the next thing they think they can do is marry us. Jem, how canyou hate Hitler so bad an then turn around and be ugly about folks right at home

Jem was suddenly furious. He leaped off the bed, grabbed me by the collar and shookme. I never wanta hear about that courthouse again, ever, ever, you hear me? Youhear me? Dont you ever say one word to me about it again, you hear? Now go on!

I was too surprised to cry. I crept from Jems room and shut the door softly, lest unduenoise set him off again. Suddenly tired, I wanted Atticus. He was in the livingroom, and Iwent to him and tried to get in his lap.

Atticus smiled. Youre getting so big now, Ill just have to hold a part of you. He heldme close. Scout, he said softly, dont let Jem get you down. Hes having a rough timethese days. I heard you back there.

Atticus said that Jem was trying hard to forget something, but what he was reallydoing was storing it away for a while, until enough time passed. Then he would be ableto think about it and sort things out. When he was able to think about it, Jem would behimself again.


Chapter 27

Things did settle down, after a fashion, as Atticus said they would. By the middle ofOctober, only two small things out of the ordinary happened to two Maycomb citizens.

No, there were three things, and they did not directly concern usthe Finchesbut in away they did.

The first thing was that Mr. Bob Ewell acquired and lost a job in a matter of days andprobably made himself unique in the annals of the nineteen-thirties: he was the onlyman I ever heard of who was fired from the WPA for laziness. I suppose his brief burstof fame brought on a briefer burst of industry, but his job lasted only as long as hisnotoriety: Mr. Ewell found himself as forgotten as Tom Robinson. Thereafter, heresumed his regular weekly appearances at the welfare office for his check, andreceived it with no grace amid obscure mutterings that the bastards who thought theyran this town wouldnt permit an honest man to make a living. Ruth Jones, the welfarelady, said Mr. Ewell openly accused Atticus of getting his job. She was upset enough towalk down to Atticuss office and tell him about it. Atticus told Miss Ruth not to fret, that ifBob Ewell wanted to discuss Atticuss getting his job, he knew the way to the office.

The second thing happened to Judge Taylor. Judge Taylor was not a Sunday-nightchurchgoer: Mrs. Taylor was. Judge Taylor savored his Sunday night hour alone in hisbig house, and churchtime found him holed up in his study reading the writings of BobTaylor (no kin, but the judge would have been proud to claim it). One Sunday night, lostin fruity metaphors and florid diction, Judge Taylors attention was wrenched from thepage by an irritating scratching noise. Hush, he said to Ann Taylor, his fat nondescriptdog. Then he realized he was speaking to an empty room; the scratching noise wascoming from the rear of the house. Judge Taylor clumped to the back porch to let Annout and found the screen door swinging open. A shadow on the corner of the housecaught his eye, and that was all he saw of his visitor. Mrs. Taylor came home fromchurch to find her husband in his chair, lost in the writings of Bob Taylor, with a shotgunacross his lap.

The third thing happened to Helen Robinson, Toms widow. If Mr. Ewell was asforgotten as Tom Robinson, Tom Robinson was as forgotten as Boo Radley. But Tomwas not forgotten by his employer, Mr. Link Deas. Mr. Link Deas made a job for Helen.

He didnt really need her, but he said he felt right bad about the way things turned out. Inever knew who took care of her children while Helen was away. Calpurnia said it washard on Helen, because she had to walk nearly a mile out of her way to avoid theEwells, who, according to Helen, chunked at her the first time she tried to use thepublic road. Mr. Link Deas eventually received the impression that Helen was coming towork each morning from the wrong direction, and dragged the reason out of her. Justlet it be, Mr. Link, please suh, Helen begged. The hell I will, said Mr. Link. He told herto come by his store that afternoon before she left. She did, and Mr. Link closed hisstore, put his hat firmly on his head, and walked Helen home. He walked her the shortway, by the Ewells. On his way back, Mr. Link stopped at the crazy gate.

Ewell? he called. I say Ewell!

The windows, normally packed with children, were empty.

I know every last one of yous in there a-layin on the floor! Now hear me, Bob Ewell:

if I hear one more peep outa my girl Helen about not bein able to walk this road Ill haveyou in jail before sundown! Mr. Link spat in the dust and walked home.

Helen went to work next morning and used the public road. Nobody chunked at her,but when she was a few yards beyond the Ewell house, she looked around and saw Mr.

Ewell walking behind her. She turned and walked on, and Mr. Ewell kept the samedistance behind her until she reached Mr. Link Deass house. All the way to the house,Helen said, she heard a soft voice behind her, crooning foul words. Thoroughlyfrightened, she telephoned Mr. Link at his store, which was not too far from his house.

As Mr. Link came out of his store he saw Mr. Ewell leaning on the fence. Mr. Ewell said,Dont you look at me, Link Deas, like I was dirt. I aint jumped your

First thing you can do, Ewell, is get your stinkin carcass off my property. Youreleanin on it an I cant afford fresh paint for it. Second thing you can do is stay awayfrom my cook or Ill have you up for assault

I aint touched her, Link Deas, and aint about to go with no nigger!

You dont have to touch her, all you have to do is make her afraid, an if assault aintenough to keep you locked up awhile, Ill get you in on the Ladies Law, so get outa mysight! If you dont think I mean it, just bother that girl again!

Mr. Ewell evidently thought he meant it, for Helen reported no further trouble.

I dont like it, Atticus, I dont like it at all, was Aunt Alexandras assessment of theseevents. That man seems to have a permanent running grudge against everybodyconnected with that case. I know how that kind are about paying off grudges, but I dontunderstand why he should harbor onehe had his way in court, didnt he?

I think I understand, said Atticus. It might be because he knows in his heart that veryfew people in Maycomb really believed his and Mayellas yarns. He thought hed be ahero, but all he got for his pain was was, okay, well convict this Negro but get back toyour dump. Hes had his fling with about everybody now, so he ought to be satisfied.

Hell settle down when the weather changes.

But why should he try to burgle John Taylors house? He obviously didnt know Johnwas home or he wouldntve tried. Only lights John shows on Sunday nights are on thefront porch and back in his den

You dont know if Bob Ewell cut that screen, you dont know who did it, said Atticus.

But I can guess. I proved him a liar but John made him look like a fool. All the timeEwell was on the stand I couldnt dare look at John and keep a straight face. Johnlooked at him as if he were a three-legged chicken or a square egg. Dont tell me judgesdont try to prejudice juries, Atticus chuckled.

By the end of October, our lives had become the familiar routine of school, play, study.

Jem seemed to have put out of his mind whatever it was he wanted to forget, and ourclassmates mercifully let us forget our fathers eccentricities. Cecil Jacobs asked meone time if Atticus was a Radical. When I asked Atticus, Atticus was so amused I wasrather annoyed, but he said he wasnt laughing at me. He said, You tell Cecil Im aboutas radical as Cotton Tom Heflin.

Aunt Alexandra was thriving. Miss Maudie must have silenced the whole missionarysociety at one blow, for Aunty again ruled that roost. Her refreshments grew even moredelicious. I learned more about the poor Mrunas social life from listening to Mrs.

Merriweather: they had so little sense of family that the whole tribe was one big family. Achild had as many fathers as there were men in the community, as many mothers asthere were women. J. Grimes Everett was doing his utmost to change this state ofaffairs, and desperately needed our prayers.

Maycomb was itself again. Precisely the same as last year and the year before that,with only two minor changes. Firstly, people had removed from their store windows andautomobiles the stickers that said NRAWE DO OUR PART. I asked Atticus why, andhe said it was because the National Recovery Act was dead. I asked who killed it: hesaid nine old men.

The second change in Maycomb since last year was not one of national significance.

Until then, Halloween in Maycomb was a completely unorganized affair. Each child didwhat he wanted to do, with assistance from other children if there was anything to bemoved, such as placing a light buggy on top of the livery stable. But parents thoughtthings went too far last year, when the peace of Miss Tutti and Miss Frutti wasshattered.

Misses Tutti and Frutti Barber were maiden ladies, sisters, who lived together in theonly Maycomb residence boasting a cellar. The Barber ladies were rumored to beRepublicans, having migrated from Clanton, Alabama, in 1911. Their ways were strangeto us, and why they wanted a cellar nobody knew, but they wanted one and they dugone, and they spent the rest of their lives chasing generations of children out of it.

Misses Tutti and Frutti (their names were Sarah and Frances), aside from theirYankee ways, were both deaf. Miss Tutti denied it and lived in a world of silence, butMiss Frutti, not about to miss anything, employed an ear trumpet so enormous that Jemdeclared it was a loudspeaker from one of those dog Victrolas.

With these facts in mind and Halloween at hand, some wicked children had waiteduntil the Misses Barber were thoroughly asleep, slipped into their livingroom (nobody butthe Radleys locked up at night), stealthily made away with every stick of furnituretherein, and hid it in the cellar. I deny having taken part in such a thing.

I heard em! was the cry that awoke the Misses Barbers neighbors at dawn nextmorning. Heard em drive a truck up to the door! Stomped around like horses. Theyrein New Orleans by now!

Miss Tutti was sure those traveling fur sellers who came through town two days agohad purloined their furniture. Da-rk they were, she said. Syrians.

Mr. Heck Tate was summoned. He surveyed the area and said he thought it was alocal job. Miss Frutti said shed know a Maycomb voice anywhere, and there were noMaycomb voices in that parlor last nightrolling their rs all over her premises, theywere. Nothing less than the bloodhounds must be used to locate their furniture, MissTutti insisted, so Mr. Tate was obliged to go ten miles out the road, round up the countyhounds, and put them on the trail.

Mr. Tate started them off at the Misses Barbers front steps, but all they did was runaround to the back of the house and howl at the cellar door. When Mr. Tate set them inmotion three times, he finally guessed the truth. By noontime that day, there was not abarefooted child to be seen in Maycomb and nobody took off his shoes until the houndswere returned.

So the Maycomb ladies said things would be different this year. The high-schoolauditorium would be open, there would be a pageant for the grown-ups; apple-bobbing,taffy-pulling, pinning the tail on the donkey for the children. There would also be a prizeof twenty-five cents for the best Halloween costume, created by the wearer.

Jem and I both groaned. Not that wed ever done anything, it was the principle of thething. Jem considered himself too old for Halloween anyway; he said he wouldnt becaught anywhere near the high school at something like that. Oh well, I thought, Atticuswould take me.

I soon learned, however, that my services would be required on stage that evening.

Mrs. Grace Merriweather had composed an original pageant entitled Maycomb County:

Ad Astra Per Aspera, and I was to be a ham. She thought it would be adorable if someof the children were costumed to represent the countys agricultural products: CecilJacobs would be dressed up to look like a cow; Agnes Boone would make a lovelybutterbean, another child would be a peanut, and on down the line until Mrs.

Merriweathers imagination and the supply of children were exhausted.

Our only duties, as far as I could gather from our two rehearsals, were to enter fromstage left as Mrs. Merriweather (not only the author, but the narrator) identified us.

When she called out, Pork, that was my cue. Then the assembled company wouldsing, Maycomb County, Maycomb County, we will aye be true to thee, as the grandfinale, and Mrs. Merriweather would mount the stage with the state flag.

My costume was not much of a problem. Mrs. Crenshaw, the local seamstress, had asmuch imagination as Mrs. Merriweather. Mrs. Crenshaw took some chicken wire andbent it into the shape of a cured ham. This she covered with brown cloth, and painted itto resemble the original. I could duck under and someone would pull the contraptiondown over my head. It came almost to my knees. Mrs. Crenshaw thoughtfully left twopeepholes for me. She did a fine job. Jem said I looked exactly like a ham with legs.

There were several discomforts, though: it was hot, it was a close fit; if my nose itched Icouldnt scratch, and once inside I could not get out of it alone.

When Halloween came, I assumed that the whole family would be present to watchme perform, but I was disappointed. Atticus said as tactfully as he could that he justdidnt think he could stand a pageant tonight, he was all in. He had been in Montgomeryfor a week and had come home late that afternoon. He thought Jem might escort me if Iasked him.

Aunt Alexandra said she just had to get to bed early, shed been decorating the stageall afternoon and was worn outshe stopped short in the middle of her sentence. Sheclosed her mouth, then opened it to say something, but no words came.

s matter, Aunty? I asked.

Oh nothing, nothing, she said, somebody just walked over my grave. She put awayfrom her whatever it was that gave her a pinprick of apprehension, and suggested that Igive the family a preview in the livingroom. So Jem squeezed me into my costume,stood at the livingroom door, called out Po-ork, exactly as Mrs. Merriweather wouldhave done, and I marched in. Atticus and Aunt Alexandra were delighted.

I repeated my part for Calpurnia in the kitchen and she said I was wonderful. I wantedto go across the street to show Miss Maudie, but Jem said shed probably be at thepageant anyway.

After that, it didnt matter whether they went or not. Jem said he would take me. Thusbegan our longest journey together.


Chapter 28

The weather was unusually warm for the last day of October. We didnt even needjackets. The wind was growing stronger, and Jem said it might be raining before we gothome. There was no moon. The street light on the corner cast sharp shadows on theRadley house. I heard Jem laugh softly. Bet nobody bothers them tonight, he said.

Jem was carrying my ham costume, rather awkwardly, as it was hard to hold. I thought itgallant of him to do so.

It is a scary place though, aint it? I said. Boo doesnt mean anybody any harm, butIm right glad youre along. You know Atticus wouldnt let you go to the schoolhouse byyourself, Jem said.

Dont see why, its just around the corner and across the yard.

That yards a mighty long place for little girls to cross at night, Jem teased. Aint youscared of haints?

We laughed. Haints, Hot Steams, incantations, secret signs, had vanished with ouryears as mist with sunrise. What was that old thing, Jem said, Angel bright, life-in-death; get off the road, dont suck my breath.

Cut it out, now, I said. We were in front of the Radley Place.

Jem said, Boo must not be at home. Listen.

High above us in the darkness a solitary mocker poured out his repertoire in blissfulunawareness of whose tree he sat in, plunging from the shrill kee, kee of the sunflowerbird to the irascible qua-ack of a bluejay, to the sad lament of Poor Will, Poor Will, PoorWill.

We turned the corner and I tripped on a root growing in the road. Jem tried to help me,but all he did was drop my costume in the dust. I didnt fall, though, and soon we wereon our way again.

We turned off the road and entered the schoolyard. It was pitch black.

How do you know where were at, Jem? I asked, when we had gone a few steps.

I can tell were under the big oak because were passin through a cool spot. Carefulnow, and dont fall again.

We had slowed to a cautious gait, and were feeling our way forward so as not to bumpinto the tree. The tree was a single and ancient oak; two children could not reach aroundits trunk and touch hands. It was far away from teachers, their spies, and curiousneighbors: it was near the Radley lot, but the Radleys were not curious. A small patch ofearth beneath its branches was packed hard from many fights and furtive crap games.

The lights in the high school auditorium were blazing in the distance, but they blindedus, if anything. Dont look ahead, Scout, Jem said. Look at the ground and you wontfall.

You should have brought the flashlight, Jem.

Didnt know it was this dark. Didnt look like itd be this dark earlier in the evening. Socloudy, thats why. Itll hold off a while, though.

Someone leaped at us.

God almighty! Jem yelled.

A circle of light burst in our faces, and Cecil Jacobs jumped in glee behind it. Ha-a-a,gotcha! he shrieked. Thought youd be comin along this way!

What are you doin way out here by yourself, boy? Aint you scared of Boo Radley?

Cecil had ridden safely to the auditorium with his parents, hadnt seen us, then hadventured down this far because he knew good and well wed be coming along. Hethought Mr. Finchd be with us, though.

Shucks, aint much but around the corner, said Jem. Whos scared to go around thecorner? We had to admit that Cecil was pretty good, though. He had given us a fright,and he could tell it all over the schoolhouse, that was his privilege.

Say, I said, aint you a cow tonight? Wheres your costume?

Its up behind the stage, he said. Mrs. Merriweather says the pageant aint cominon for a while. You can put yours back of the stage by mine, Scout, and we can go withthe rest of em.

This was an excellent idea, Jem thought. He also thought it a good thing that Ceciland I would be together. This way, Jem would be left to go with people his own age.

When we reached the auditorium, the whole town was there except Atticus and theladies worn out from decorating, and the usual outcasts and shut-ins. Most of thecounty, it seemed, was there: the hall was teeming with slicked-up country people. Thehigh school building had a wide downstairs hallway; people milled around booths thathad been installed along each side.

Oh Jem. I forgot my money, I sighed, when I saw them.

Atticus didnt, Jem said. Heres thirty cents, you can do six things. See you later on.

Okay, I said, quite content with thirty cents and Cecil. I went with Cecil down to thefront of the auditorium, through a door on one side, and backstage. I got rid of my hamcostume and departed in a hurry, for Mrs. Merriweather was standing at a lectern infront of the first row of seats making last-minute, frenzied changes in the script.

How much money you got? I asked Cecil. Cecil had thirty cents, too, which made useven. We squandered our first nickels on the House of Horrors, which scared us not atall; we entered the black seventh-grade room and were led around by the temporaryghoul in residence and were made to touch several objects alleged to be componentparts of a human being. Heres his eyes, we were told when we touched two peeledgrapes on a saucer. Heres his heart, which felt like raw liver. These are his innards,

and our hands were thrust into a plate of cold spaghetti.

Cecil and I visited several booths. We each bought a sack of Mrs. Judge Taylorshomemade divinity. I wanted to bob for apples, but Cecil said it wasnt sanitary. Hismother said he might catch something from everybodys heads having been in the sametub. Aint anything around town now to catch, I protested. But Cecil said his mothersaid it was unsanitary to eat after folks. I later asked Aunt Alexandra about this, and shesaid people who held such views were usually climbers.

We were about to purchase a blob of taffy when Mrs. Merriweathers runnersappeared and told us to go backstage, it was time to get ready. The auditorium wasfilling with people; the Maycomb County High School band had assembled in front belowthe stage; the stage footlights were on and the red velvet curtain rippled and billowedfrom the scurrying going on behind it.

Backstage, Cecil and I found the narrow hallway teeming with people: adults inhomemade three-corner hats, Confederate caps, Spanish-American War hats, andWorld War helmets. Children dressed as various agricultural enterprises crowdedaround the one small window.

Somebodys mashed my costume, I wailed in dismay. Mrs. Merriweather galloped tome, reshaped the chicken wire, and thrust me inside.

You all right in there, Scout? asked Cecil. You sound so far off, like you was on theother side of a hill.

You dont sound any nearer, I said.

The band played the national anthem, and we heard the audience rise. Then the bassdrum sounded. Mrs. Merriweather, stationed behind her lectern beside the band, said:

Maycomb County Ad Astra Per Aspera. The bass drum boomed again. That means,

said Mrs. Merriweather, translating for the rustic elements, from the mud to the stars.

She added, unnecessarily, it seemed to me, A pageant.

Reckon they wouldnt know what it was if she didnt tell em, whispered Cecil, whowas immediately shushed.

The whole town knows it, I breathed.

But the country folksve come in, Cecil said.

Be quiet back there, a mans voice ordered, and we were silent.

The bass drum went boom with every sentence Mrs. Merriweather uttered. Shechanted mournfully about Maycomb County being older than the state, that it was a partof the Mississippi and Alabama Territories, that the first white man to set foot in thevirgin forests was the Probate Judges great-grandfather five times removed, who wasnever heard of again. Then came the fearless Colonel Maycomb, for whom the countywas named.

Andrew Jackson appointed him to a position of authority, and Colonel Maycombsmisplaced self-confidence and slender sense of direction brought disaster to all whorode with him in the Creek Indian Wars. Colonel Maycomb persevered in his efforts tomake the region safe for democracy, but his first campaign was his last. His orders,relayed to him by a friendly Indian runner, were to move south. After consulting a tree toascertain from its lichen which way was south, and taking no lip from the subordinateswho ventured to correct him, Colonel Maycomb set out on a purposeful journey to routthe enemy and entangled his troops so far northwest in the forest primeval that theywere eventually rescued by settlers moving inland.

Mrs. Merriweather gave a thirty-minute description of Colonel Maycombs exploits. Idiscovered that if I bent my knees I could tuck them under my costume and more or lesssit. I sat down, listened to Mrs. Merriweathers drone and the bass drums boom andwas soon fast asleep.

They said later that Mrs. Merriweather was putting her all into the grand finale, thatshe had crooned, Po-ork, with a confidence born of pine trees and butterbeansentering on cue. She waited a few seconds, then called, Po-ork? When nothingmaterialized, she yelled, Pork!

I must have heard her in my sleep, or the band playing Dixie woke me, but it waswhen Mrs. Merriweather triumphantly mounted the stage with the state flag that I choseto make my entrance. Chose is incorrect: I thought Id better catch up with the rest ofthem.

They told me later that Judge Taylor went out behind the auditorium and stood thereslapping his knees so hard Mrs. Taylor brought him a glass of water and one of his pills.

Mrs. Merriweather seemed to have a hit, everybody was cheering so, but she caughtme backstage and told me I had ruined her pageant. She made me feel awful, but whenJem came to fetch me he was sympathetic. He said he couldnt see my costume muchfrom where he was sitting. How he could tell I was feeling bad under my costume I dontknow, but he said I did all right, I just came in a little late, that was all. Jem wasbecoming almost as good as Atticus at making you feel right when things went wrong.

Almostnot even Jem could make me go through that crowd, and he consented to waitbackstage with me until the audience left.

You wanta take it off, Scout? he asked.

Naw, Ill just keep it on, I said. I could hide my mortification under it.

You all want a ride home? someone asked.

No sir, thank you, I heard Jem say. Its just a little walk.

Be careful of haints, the voice said. Better still, tell the haints to be careful of Scout.

There arent many folks left now, Jem told me. Lets go.

We went through the auditorium to the hallway, then down the steps. It was still blackdark. The remaining cars were parked on the other side of the building, and theirheadlights were little help. If some of em were goin in our direction we could seebetter, said Jem. Here Scout, let me hold onto yourhock. You might lose yourbalance.

I can see all right.

Yeah, but you might lose your balance. I felt a slight pressure on my head, andassumed that Jem had grabbed that end of the ham. You got me?

Uh huh.

We began crossing the black schoolyard, straining to see our feet. Jem, I said, Iforgot my shoes, theyre back behind the stage.

Well lets go get em. But as we turned around the auditorium lights went off. Youcan get em tomorrow, he said.

But tomorrows Sunday, I protested, as Jem turned me homeward.

You can get the Janitor to let you in Scout?

Hm?

Nothing.

Jem hadnt started that in a long time. I wondered what he was thinking. Hed tell mewhen he wanted to, probably when we got home. I felt his fingers press the top of mycostume, too hard, it seemed. I shook my head. Jem, you dont hafta

Hush a minute, Scout, he said, pinching me.

We walked along silently. Minutes up, I said. Whatcha thinkin about? I turned tolook at him, but his outline was barely visible.

Thought I heard something, he said. Stop a minute.

We stopped.

Hear anything? he asked.

No.

We had not gone five paces before he made me stop again.

Jem, are you tryin to scare me? You know Im too old

Be quiet, he said, and I knew he was not joking.

The night was still. I could hear his breath coming easily beside me. Occasionallythere was a sudden breeze that hit my bare legs, but it was all that remained of apromised windy night. This was the stillness before a thunderstorm. We listened.

Heard an old dog just then, I said.

Its not that, Jem answered. I hear it when were walkin along, but when we stop Idont hear it.

You hear my costume rustlin. Aw, its just Halloween got you

I said it more to convince myself than Jem, for sure enough, as we began walking, Iheard what he was talking about. It was not my costume.

Its just old Cecil, said Jem presently. He wont get us again. Lets dont let him thinkwere hurrying.

We slowed to a crawl. I asked Jem how Cecil could follow us in this dark, looked to melike hed bump into us from behind.

I can see you, Scout, Jem said.

How? I cant see you.

Your fat streaks are showin. Mrs. Crenshaw painted em with some of that shiny stuffso theyd show up under the footlights. I can see you pretty well, an I expect Cecil cansee you well enough to keep his distance.

I would show Cecil that we knew he was behind us and we were ready for him. CecilJacobs is a big wet he-en! I yelled suddenly, turning around.

We stopped. There was no acknowledgement save he-en bouncing off the distantschoolhouse wall.

Ill get him, said Jem. He-y!

Hay-e-hay-e-hay-ey, answered the schoolhouse wall. It was unlike Cecil to hold out forso long; once he pulled a joke hed repeat it time and again. We should have been leaptat already. Jem signaled for me to stop again.

He said softly, Scout, can you take that thing off?

I think so, but I aint got anything on under it much.

Ive got your dress here.

I cant get it on in the dark.

Okay, he said, never mind.

Jem, are you afraid?

No. Think were almost to the tree now. Few yards from that, an well be to the road.

We can see the street light then. Jem was talking in an unhurried, flat toneless voice. Iwondered how long he would try to keep the Cecil myth going.

You reckon we oughta sing, Jem?

No. Be real quiet again, Scout.

We had not increased our pace. Jem knew as well as I that it was difficult to walk fastwithout stumping a toe, tripping on stones, and other inconveniences, and I wasbarefooted. Maybe it was the wind rustling the trees. But there wasnt any wind andthere werent any trees except the big oak.

Our company shuffled and dragged his feet, as if wearing heavy shoes. Whoever itwas wore thick cotton pants; what I thought were trees rustling was the soft swish ofcotton on cotton, wheek, wheek, with every step.

I felt the sand go cold under my feet and I knew we were near the big oak. Jempressed my head. We stopped and listened.

Shuffle-foot had not stopped with us this time. His trousers swished softly and steadily.

Then they stopped. He was running, running toward us with no childs steps.

Run, Scout! Run! Run! Jem screamed.

I took one giant step and found myself reeling: my arms useless, in the dark, I couldnot keep my balance.

Jem, Jem, help me, Jem!

Something crushed the chicken wire around me. Metal ripped on metal and I fell to theground and rolled as far as I could, floundering to escape my wire prison. Fromsomewhere near by came scuffling, kicking sounds, sounds of shoes and flesh scrapingdirt and roots. Someone rolled against me and I felt Jem. He was up like lightning andpulling me with him but, though my head and shoulders were free, I was so entangledwe didnt get very far.

We were nearly to the road when I felt Jems hand leave me, felt him jerk backwardsto the ground. More scuffling, and there came a dull crunching sound and Jemscreamed.

I ran in the direction of Jems scream and sank into a flabby male stomach. Its ownersaid, Uff! and tried to catch my arms, but they were tightly pinioned. His stomach wassoft but his arms were like steel. He slowly squeezed the breath out of me. I could notmove. Suddenly he was jerked backwards and flung on the ground, almost carrying mewith him. I thought, Jems up.

Ones mind works very slowly at times. Stunned, I stood there dumbly. The scufflingnoises were dying; someone wheezed and the night was still again.

Still but for a man breathing heavily, breathing heavily and staggering. I thought hewent to the tree and leaned against it. He coughed violently, a sobbing, bone-shakingcough.

Jem?

There was no answer but the mans heavy breathing.

Jem?

Jem didnt answer.

The man began moving around, as if searching for something. I heard him groan andpull something heavy along the ground. It was slowly coming to me that there were nowfour people under the tree.

Atticus?

The man was walking heavily and unsteadily toward the road.

I went to where I thought he had been and felt frantically along the ground, reachingout with my toes. Presently I touched someone.

Jem?

My toes touched trousers, a belt buckle, buttons, something I could not identify, acollar, and a face. A prickly stubble on the face told me it was not Jems. I smelled stalewhiskey.

I made my way along in what I thought was the direction of the road. I was not sure,because I had been turned around so many times. But I found it and looked down to thestreet light. A man was passing under it. The man was walking with the staccato stepsof someone carrying a load too heavy for him. He was going around the corner. He wascarrying Jem. Jems arm was dangling crazily in front of him.

By the time I reached the corner the man was crossing our front yard. Light from ourfront door framed Atticus for an instant; he ran down the steps, and together, he and theman took Jem inside.

I was at the front door when they were going down the hall. Aunt Alexandra wasrunning to meet me. Call Dr. Reynolds! Atticuss voice came sharply from Jems room.

Wheres Scout?

Here she is, Aunt Alexandra called, pulling me along with her to the telephone. Shetugged at me anxiously. Im all right, Aunty, I said, you better call.

She pulled the receiver from the hook and said, Eula May, get Dr. Reynolds, quick!

Agnes, is your father home? Oh God, where is he? Please tell him to come over hereas soon as he comes in. Please, its urgent!

There was no need for Aunt Alexandra to identify herself, people in Maycomb kneweach others voices.

Atticus came out of Jems room. The moment Aunt Alexandra broke the connection,Atticus took the receiver from her. He rattled the hook, then said, Eula May, get me thesheriff, please.

Heck? Atticus Finch. Someones been after my children. Jems hurt. Between hereand the schoolhouse. I cant leave my boy. Run out there for me, please, and see if hesstill around. Doubt if youll find him now, but Id like to see him if you do. Got to go now.

Thanks, Heck.

Atticus, is Jem dead?

No, Scout. Look after her, sister, he called, as he went down the hall.

Aunt Alexandras fingers trembled as she unwound the crushed fabric and wire fromaround me. Are you all right, darling? she asked over and over as she worked me free.

It was a relief to be out. My arms were beginning to tingle, and they were red withsmall hexagonal marks. I rubbed them, and they felt better.

Aunty, is Jem dead?

Nono, darling, hes unconscious. We wont know how badly hes hurt until Dr.

Reynolds gets here. Jean Louise, what happened?

I dont know.

She left it at that. She brought me something to put on, and had I thought about itthen, I would have never let her forget it: in her distraction, Aunty brought me myoveralls. Put these on, darling, she said, handing me the garments she most despised.

She rushed back to Jems room, then came to me in the hall. She patted me vaguely,and went back to Jems room.

A car stopped in front of the house. I knew Dr. Reynoldss step almost as well as myfathers. He had brought Jem and me into the world, had led us through every childhooddisease known to man including the time Jem fell out of the treehouse, and he hadnever lost our friendship. Dr. Reynolds said if we had been boil-prone things would havebeen different, but we doubted it.

He came in the door and said, Good Lord. He walked toward me, said, Youre stillstanding, and changed his course. He knew every room in the house. He also knewthat if I was in bad shape, so was Jem.

After ten forevers Dr. Reynolds returned. Is Jem dead? I asked.

Far from it, he said, squatting down to me. Hes got a bump on the head just likeyours, and a broken arm. Scout, look that wayno, dont turn your head, roll your eyes.

Now look over yonder. Hes got a bad break, so far as I can tell now its in the elbow.

Like somebody tried to wring his arm off Now look at me.

Then hes not dead?

No-o! Dr. Reynolds got to his feet. We cant do much tonight, he said, except try tomake him as comfortable as we can. Well have to X-ray his armlooks like hell bewearing his arm way out by his side for a while. Dont worry, though, hell be as good asnew. Boys his age bounce.

While he was talking, Dr. Reynolds had been looking keenly at me, lightly fingering thebump that was coming on my forehead. You dont feel broke anywhere, do you?

Dr. Reynoldss small joke made me smile. Then you dont think hes dead, then?

He put on his hat. Now I may be wrong, of course, but I think hes very alive. Showsall the symptoms of it. Go have a look at him, and when I come back well get togetherand decide.

Dr. Reynoldss step was young and brisk. Mr. Heck Tates was not. His heavy bootspunished the porch and he opened the door awkwardly, but he said the same thing Dr.

Reynolds said when he came in. You all right, Scout? he added.

Yes sir, Im goin in to see Jem. Atticusnthems in there.

Ill go with you, said Mr. Tate.

Aunt Alexandra had shaded Jems reading light with a towel, and his room was dim.

Jem was lying on his back. There was an ugly mark along one side of his face. His leftarm lay out from his body; his elbow was bent slightly, but in the wrong direction. Jemwas frowning.

Jem?

Atticus spoke. He cant hear you, Scout, hes out like a light. He was coming around,but Dr. Reynolds put him out again.

Yes sir. I retreated. Jems room was large and square. Aunt Alexandra was sitting ina rocking-chair by the fireplace. The man who brought Jem in was standing in a corner,leaning against the wall. He was some countryman I did not know. He had probablybeen at the pageant, and was in the vicinity when it happened. He must have heard ourscreams and come running.

Atticus was standing by Jems bed.

Mr. Heck Tate stood in the doorway. His hat was in his hand, and a flashlight bulgedfrom his pants pocket. He was in his working clothes.

Come in, Heck, said Atticus. Did you find anything? I cant conceive of anyone low-down enough to do a thing like this, but I hope you found him.

Mr. Tate sniffed. He glanced sharply at the man in the corner, nodded to him, thenlooked around the roomat Jem, at Aunt Alexandra, then at Atticus.

Sit down, Mr. Finch, he said pleasantly.

Atticus said, Lets all sit down. Have that chair, Heck. Ill get another one from thelivingroom.

Mr. Tate sat in Jems desk chair. He waited until Atticus returned and settled himself. Iwondered why Atticus had not brought a chair for the man in the corner, but Atticusknew the ways of country people far better than I. Some of his rural clients would parktheir long-eared steeds under the chinaberry trees in the back yard, and Atticus wouldoften keep appointments on the back steps. This one was probably more comfortablewhere he was.

Mr. Finch, said Mr. Tate, tell you what I found. I found a little girls dressits outthere in my car. That your dress, Scout?

Yes sir, if its a pink one with smockin, I said. Mr. Tate was behaving as if he wereon the witness stand. He liked to tell things his own way, untrammeled by state ordefense, and sometimes it took him a while.

I found some funny-looking pieces of muddy-colored cloth

Thats mcostume, Mr. Tate.

Mr. Tate ran his hands down his thighs. He rubbed his left arm and investigated Jemsmantelpiece, then he seemed to be interested in the fireplace. His fingers sought hislong nose.

What is it, Heck? said Atticus.

Mr. Tate found his neck and rubbed it. Bob Ewells lyin on the ground under that treedown yonder with a kitchen knife stuck up under his ribs. Hes dead, Mr. Finch.

Chapter 29

Aunt Alexandra got up and reached for the mantelpiece. Mr. Tate rose, but shedeclined assistance. For once in his life, Atticuss instinctive courtesy failed him: he satwhere he was.

Somehow, I could think of nothing but Mr. Bob Ewell saying hed get Atticus if it tookhim the rest of his life. Mr. Ewell almost got him, and it was the last thing he did.

Are you sure? Atticus said bleakly.

Hes dead all right, said Mr. Tate. Hes good and dead. He wont hurt these childrenagain.

I didnt mean that. Atticus seemed to be talking in his sleep. His age was beginningto show, his one sign of inner turmoil, the strong line of his jaw melted a little, onebecame aware of telltale creases forming under his ears, one noticed not his jet-blackhair but the gray patches growing at his temples.

Hadnt we better go to the livingroom? Aunt Alexandra said at last.

If you dont mind, said Mr. Tate, Id rather us stay in here if it wont hurt Jem any. Iwant to have a look at his injuries while Scout tells us about it.

Is it all right if I leave? she asked. Im just one person too many in here. Ill be in myroom if you want me, Atticus. Aunt Alexandra went to the door, but she stopped andturned. Atticus, I had a feeling about this tonightIthis is my fault, she began. Ishould have

Mr. Tate held up his hand. You go ahead, Miss Alexandra, I know its been a shock toyou. And dont you fret yourself about anythingwhy, if we followed our feelings all thetime wed be like cats chasin their tails. Miss Scout, see if you can tell us whathappened, while its still fresh in your mind. You think you can? Did you see himfollowing you?

I went to Atticus and felt his arms go around me. I buried my head in his lap. Westarted home. I said Jem, Ive forgot mshoes. Soons we started back for em the lightswent out. Jem said I could get em tomorrow

Scout, raise up so Mr. Tate can hear you, Atticus said. I crawled into his lap.

Then Jem said hush a minute. I thought he was thinkinhe always wants you tohush so he can thinkthen he said he heard somethin. We thought it was Cecil.

Cecil?

Cecil Jacobs. He scared us once tonight, an we thought it was him again. He had ona sheet. They gave a quarter for the best costume, I dont know who won it

Where were you when you thought it was Cecil?

Just a little piece from the schoolhouse. I yelled somethin at him

You yelled, what?

Cecil Jacobs is a big fat hen, I think. We didnt hear nothinthen Jem yelled hello orsomethin loud enough to wake the dead

Just a minute, Scout, said Mr. Tate. Mr. Finch, did you hear them?

Atticus said he didnt. He had the radio on. Aunt Alexandra had hers going in herbedroom. He remembered because she told him to turn his down a bit so she couldhear hers. Atticus smiled. I always play a radio too loud.

I wonder if the neighbors heard anything said Mr. Tate.

I doubt it, Heck. Most of them listen to their radios or go to bed with the chickens.

Maudie Atkinson may have been up, but I doubt it.

Go ahead, Scout, Mr. Tate said.

Well, after Jem yelled we walked on. Mr. Tate, I was shut up in my costume but Icould hear it myself, then. Footsteps, I mean. They walked when we walked andstopped when we stopped. Jem said he could see me because Mrs. Crenshaw putsome kind of shiny paint on my costume. I was a ham.

Hows that? asked Mr. Tate, startled.

Atticus described my role to Mr. Tate, plus the construction of my garment. Youshould have seen her when she came in, he said, it was crushed to a pulp.

Mr. Tate rubbed his chin. I wondered why he had those marks on him, His sleeveswere perforated with little holes. There were one or two little puncture marks on his armsto match the holes. Let me see that thing if you will, sir.

Atticus fetched the remains of my costume. Mr. Tate turned it over and bent it aroundto get an idea of its former shape. This thing probably saved her life, he said. Look.

He pointed with a long forefinger. A shiny clean line stood out on the dull wire. BobEwell meant business, Mr. Tate muttered.

He was out of his mind, said Atticus.

Dont like to contradict you, Mr. Finchwasnt crazy, mean as hell. Low-down skunkwith enough liquor in him to make him brave enough to kill children. Hed never havemet you face to face.

Atticus shook his head. I cant conceive of a man whod

Mr. Finch, theres just some kind of men you have to shoot before you can say hidy toem. Even then, they aint worth the bullet it takes to shoot em. Ewell as one of em.

Atticus said, I thought he got it all out of him the day he threatened me. Even if hehadnt, I thought hed come after me.

He had guts enough to pester a poor colored woman, he had guts enough to pesterJudge Taylor when he thought the house was empty, so do you think heda met you toyour face in daylight? Mr. Tate sighed. Wed better get on. Scout, you heard himbehind you

Yes sir. When we got under the tree

Howd you know you were under the tree, you couldnt see thunder out there.

I was barefooted, and Jem says the grounds always cooler under a tree.

Well have to make him a deputy, go ahead.

Then all of a sudden somethin grabbed me an mashed my costume think I duckedon the ground heard a tusslin under the tree sort of they were bammin against thetrunk, sounded like. Jem found me and started pullin me toward the road. SomeMr.

Ewell yanked him down, I reckon. They tussled some more and then there was thisfunny noiseJem hollered I stopped. That was Jems arm.

Anyway, Jem hollered and I didnt hear him any more an the next thingMr. Ewellwas tryin to squeeze me to death, I reckon then somebody yanked Mr. Ewell down.

Jem must have got up, I guess. Thats all I know

And then? Mr. Tate was looking at me sharply.

Somebody was staggerin around and pantin andcoughing fit to die. I thought itwas Jem at first, but it didnt sound like him, so I went lookin for Jem on the ground. Ithought Atticus had come to help us and had got wore out

Who was it?

Why there he is, Mr. Tate, he can tell you his name.

As I said it, I half pointed to the man in the corner, but brought my arm down quicklylest Atticus reprimand me for pointing. It was impolite to point.

He was still leaning against the wall. He had been leaning against the wall when Icame into the room, his arms folded across his chest. As I pointed he brought his armsdown and pressed the palms of his hands against the wall. They were white hands,sickly white hands that had never seen the sun, so white they stood out garishly againstthe dull cream wall in the dim light of Jems room.

I looked from his hands to his sand-stained khaki pants; my eyes traveled up his thinframe to his torn denim shirt. His face was as white as his hands, but for a shadow onhis jutting chin. His cheeks were thin to hollowness; his mouth was wide; there wereshallow, almost delicate indentations at his temples, and his gray eyes were so colorlessI thought he was blind. His hair was dead and thin, almost feathery on top of his head.

When I pointed to him his palms slipped slightly, leaving greasy sweat streaks on thewall, and he hooked his thumbs in his belt. A strange small spasm shook him, as if heheard fingernails scrape slate, but as I gazed at him in wonder the tension slowlydrained from his face. His lips parted into a timid smile, and our neighbors imageblurred with my sudden tears.

Hey, Boo, I said.


Chapter 30

Mr. Arthur, honey, said Atticus, gently correcting me. Jean Louise, this is Mr. ArthurRadley. I believe he already knows you.

If Atticus could blandly introduce me to Boo Radley at a time like this, wellthat wasAtticus.

Boo saw me run instinctively to the bed where Jem was sleeping, for the same shysmile crept across his face. Hot with embarrassment, I tried to cover up by covering Jemup.

Ah-ah, dont touch him, Atticus said.

Mr. Heck Tate sat looking intently at Boo through his horn-rimmed glasses. He wasabout to speak when Dr. Reynolds came down the hall.

Everybody out, he said, as he came in the door. Evenin, Arthur, didnt notice youthe first time I was here.

Dr. Reynoldss voice was as breezy as his step, as though he had said it everyevening of his life, an announcement that astounded me even more than being in thesame room with Boo Radley. Of course even Boo Radley got sick sometimes, Ithought. But on the other hand I wasnt sure.

Dr. Reynolds was carrying a big package wrapped in newspaper. He put it down onJems desk and took off his coat. Youre quite satisfied hes alive, now? Tell you how Iknew. When I tried to examine him he kicked me. Had to put him out good and proper totouch him. So scat, he said to me.

Er said Atticus, glancing at Boo. Heck, lets go out on the front porch. There areplenty of chairs out there, and its still warm enough.

I wondered why Atticus was inviting us to the front porch instead of the livingroom,then I understood. The livingroom lights were awfully strong.

We filed out, first Mr. TateAtticus was waiting at the door for him to go ahead of him.

Then he changed his mind and followed Mr. Tate.

People have a habit of doing everyday things even under the oddest conditions. I wasno exception: Come along, Mr. Arthur, I heard myself saying, you dont know thehouse real well. Ill just take you to the porch, sir.

He looked down at me and nodded.

I led him through the hall and past the livingroom.

Wont you have a seat, Mr. Arthur? This rocking-chairs nice and comfortable.

My small fantasy about him was alive again: he would be sitting on the porch rightpretty spell were having, isnt it, Mr. Arthur?

Yes, a right pretty spell. Feeling slightly unreal, I led him to the chair farthest fromAtticus and Mr. Tate. It was in deep shadow. Boo would feel more comfortable in thedark.

Atticus was sitting in the swing, and Mr. Tate was in a chair next to him. The light fromthe livingroom windows was strong on them. I sat beside Boo.

Well, Heck, Atticus was saying, I guess the thing to dogood Lord, Im losing mymemory Atticus pushed up his glasses and pressed his fingers to his eyes. Jemsnot quite thirteen no, hes already thirteenI cant remember. Anyway, itll comebefore county court

What will, Mr. Finch? Mr. Tate uncrossed his legs and leaned forward.

Of course it was clear-cut self defense, but Ill have to go to the office and hunt up

Mr. Finch, do you think Jem killed Bob Ewell? Do you think that?

You heard what Scout said, theres no doubt about it. She said Jem got up andyanked him off herhe probably got hold of Ewells knife somehow in the dark wellfind out tomorrow.

Mis-ter Finch, hold on, said Mr. Tate. Jem never stabbed Bob Ewell.

Atticus was silent for a moment. He looked at Mr. Tate as if he appreciated what hesaid. But Atticus shook his head.

Heck, its mighty kind of you and I know youre doing it from that good heart of yours,but dont start anything like that.

Mr. Tate got up and went to the edge of the porch. He spat into the shrubbery, thenthrust his hands into his hip pockets and faced Atticus. Like what? he said.

Im sorry if I spoke sharply, Heck, Atticus said simply, but nobodys hushing this up.

I dont live that way.

Nobodys gonna hush anything up, Mr. Finch.

Mr. Tates voice was quiet, but his boots were planted so solidly on the porchfloorboards it seemed that they grew there. A curious contest, the nature of whicheluded me, was developing between my father and the sheriff.

It was Atticuss turn to get up and go to the edge of the porch. He said, Hrm, andspat dryly into the yard. He put his hands in his pockets and faced Mr. Tate.

Heck, you havent said it, but I know what youre thinking. Thank you for it. JeanLouise he turned to me. You said Jem yanked Mr. Ewell off you?

Yes sir, thats what I thought I

See there, Heck? Thank you from the bottom of my heart, but I dont want my boystarting out with something like this over his head. Best way to clear the air is to have itall out in the open. Let the county come and bring sandwiches. I dont want him growingup with a whisper about him, I dont want anybody saying, Jem Finch his daddy paida mint to get him out of that. Sooner we get this over with the better.

Mr. Finch, Mr. Tate said stolidly, Bob Ewell fell on his knife. He killed himself.

Atticus walked to the corner of the porch. He looked at the wisteria vine. In his ownway, I thought, each was as stubborn as the other. I wondered who would give in first.

Atticuss stubbornness was quiet and rarely evident, but in some ways he was as set asthe Cunninghams. Mr. Tates was unschooled and blunt, but it was equal to my fathers.

Heck, Atticuss back was turned. If this things hushed up itll be a simple denial toJem of the way Ive tried to raise him. Sometimes I think Im a total failure as a parent,but Im all theyve got. Before Jem looks at anyone else he looks at me, and Ive tried tolive so I can look squarely back at him if I connived at something like this, frankly Icouldnt meet his eye, and the day I cant do that Ill know Ive lost him. I dont want tolose him and Scout, because theyre all Ive got.

Mr. Finch. Mr. Tate was still planted to the floorboards. Bob Ewell fell on his knife. Ican prove it.

Atticus wheeled around. His hands dug into his pockets. Heck, cant you even try tosee it my way? Youve got children of your own, but Im older than you. When mine aregrown Ill be an old man if Im still around, but right now Imif they dont trust me theywont trust anybody. Jem and Scout know what happened. If they hear of me sayingdowntown something different happenedHeck, I wont have them any more. I cantlive one way in town and another way in my home.

Mr. Tate rocked on his heels and said patiently, Hed flung Jem down, he stumbledover a root under that tree andlook, I can show you.

Mr. Tate reached in his side pocket and withdrew a long switchblade knife. As he didso, Dr. Reynolds came to the door. The sondeceaseds under that tree, doctor, justinside the schoolyard. Got a flashlight? Better have this one.

I can ease around and turn my car lights on, said Dr. Reynolds, but he took Mr.

Tates flashlight. Jems all right. He wont wake up tonight, I hope, so dont worry. Thatthe knife that killed him, Heck?

No sir, still in him. Looked like a kitchen knife from the handle. Ken oughta be therewith the hearse by now, doctor, night.

Mr. Tate flicked open the knife. It was like this, he said. He held the knife andpretended to stumble; as he leaned forward his left arm went down in front of him. Seethere? Stabbed himself through that soft stuff between his ribs. His whole weight drove itin.

Mr. Tate closed the knife and jammed it back in his pocket. Scout is eight years old,

he said. She was too scared to know exactly what went on.

Youd be surprised, Atticus said grimly.

Im not sayin she made it up, Im sayin she was too scared to know exactly whathappened. It was mighty dark out there, black as ink. d take somebody mighty used tothe dark to make a competent witness

I wont have it, Atticus said softly.

God damn it, Im not thinking of Jem!

Mr. Tates boot hit the floorboards so hard the lights in Miss Maudies bedroom wenton. Miss Stephanie Crawfords lights went on. Atticus and Mr. Tate looked across thestreet, then at each other. They waited.

When Mr. Tate spoke again his voice was barely audible. Mr. Finch, I hate to fightyou when youre like this. Youve been under a strain tonight no man should ever haveto go through. Why you aint in the bed from it I dont know, but I do know that for onceyou havent been able to put two and two together, and weve got to settle this tonightbecause tomorrowll be too late. Bob Ewells got a kitchen knife in his craw.

Mr. Tate added that Atticus wasnt going to stand there and maintain that any boyJems size with a busted arm had fight enough left in him to tackle and kill a grown manin the pitch dark.

Heck, said Atticus abruptly, that was a switchblade you were waving. Whered youget it?

Took it off a drunk man, Mr. Tate answered coolly.

I was trying to remember. Mr. Ewell was on me then he went down Jem musthave gotten up. At least I thoughtHeck?

I said I took it off a drunk man downtown tonight. Ewell probably found that kitchenknife in the dump somewhere. Honed it down and bided his time just bided his time.

Atticus made his way to the swing and sat down. His hands dangled limply betweenhis knees. He was looking at the floor. He had moved with the same slowness that nightin front of the jail, when I thought it took him forever to fold his newspaper and toss it inhis chair.

Mr. Tate clumped softly around the porch. It aint your decision, Mr. Finch, its allmine. Its my decision and my responsibility. For once, if you dont see it my way, theresnot much you can do about it. If you wanta try, Ill call you a liar to your face. Your boynever stabbed Bob Ewell, he said slowly, didnt come near a mile of it and now youknow it. All he wanted to do was get him and his sister safely home.

Mr. Tate stopped pacing. He stopped in front of Atticus, and his back was to us. Imnot a very good man, sir, but I am sheriff of Maycomb County. Lived in this town all mylife an Im goin on forty-three years old. Know everything thats happened here sincebefore I was born. Theres a black boy dead for no reason, and the man responsible forits dead. Let the dead bury the dead this time, Mr. Finch. Let the dead bury the dead.

Mr. Tate went to the swing and picked up his hat. It was lying beside Atticus. Mr. Tatepushed back his hair and put his hat on.

I never heard tell that its against the law for a citizen to do his utmost to prevent acrime from being committed, which is exactly what he did, but maybe youll say its myduty to tell the town all about it and not hush it up. Know whatd happen then? All theladies in Maycomb includin my wifed be knocking on his door bringing angel foodcakes. To my way of thinkin, Mr. Finch, taking the one man whos done you and thistown a great service an draggin him with his shy ways into the limelightto me, thats asin. Its a sin and Im not about to have it on my head. If it was any other man, itd bedifferent. But not this man, Mr. Finch.

Mr. Tate was trying to dig a hole in the floor with the toe of his boot. He pulled hisnose, then he massaged his left arm. I may not be much, Mr. Finch, but Im still sheriffof Maycomb County and Bob Ewell fell on his knife. Good night, sir.

Mr. Tate stamped off the porch and strode across the front yard. His car doorslammed and he drove away.

Atticus sat looking at the floor for a long time. Finally he raised his head. Scout, hesaid, Mr. Ewell fell on his knife. Can you possibly understand?

Atticus looked like he needed cheering up. I ran to him and hugged him and kissedhim with all my might. Yes sir, I understand, I reassured him. Mr. Tate was right.

Atticus disengaged himself and looked at me. What do you mean?

Well, itd be sort of like shootin a mockingbird, wouldnt it?

Atticus put his face in my hair and rubbed it. When he got up and walked across theporch into the shadows, his youthful step had returned. Before he went inside thehouse, he stopped in front of Boo Radley. Thank you for my children, Arthur, he said.


Chapter 31

When Boo Radley shuffled to his feet, light from the livingroom windows glistened onhis forehead. Every move he made was uncertain, as if he were not sure his hands andfeet could make proper contact with the things he touched. He coughed his dreadfulraling cough, and was so shaken he had to sit down again. His hand searched for hiship pocket, and he pulled out a handkerchief. He coughed into it, then he wiped hisforehead.

Having been so accustomed to his absence, I found it incredible that he had beensitting beside me all this time, present. He had not made a sound.

Once more, he got to his feet. He turned to me and nodded toward the front door.

Youd like to say good night to Jem, wouldnt you, Mr. Arthur? Come right in.

I led him down the hall. Aunt Alexandra was sitting by Jems bed. Come in, Arthur,

she said. Hes still asleep. Dr. Reynolds gave him a heavy sedative. Jean Louise, isyour father in the livingroom?

Yes maam, I think so.

Ill just go speak to him a minute. Dr. Reynolds left some her voice trailed away.

Boo had drifted to a corner of the room, where he stood with his chin up, peering froma distance at Jem. I took him by the hand, a hand surprisingly warm for its whiteness. Itugged him a little, and he allowed me to lead him to Jems bed.

Dr. Reynolds had made a tent-like arrangement over Jems arm, to keep the cover off,I guess, and Boo leaned forward and looked over it. An expression of timid curiosity wason his face, as though he had never seen a boy before. His mouth was slightly open,and he looked at Jem from head to foot. Boos hand came up, but he let it drop to hisside.

You can pet him, Mr. Arthur, hes asleep. You couldnt if he was awake, though, hewouldnt let you I found myself explaining. Go ahead.

Boos hand hovered over Jems head.

Go on, sir, hes asleep.

His hand came down lightly on Jems hair.

I was beginning to learn his body English. His hand tightened on mine and heindicated that he wanted to leave.

I led him to the front porch, where his uneasy steps halted. He was still holding myhand and he gave no sign of letting me go.

Will you take me home?

He almost whispered it, in the voice of a child afraid of the dark.

I put my foot on the top step and stopped. I would lead him through our house, but Iwould never lead him home.

Mr. Arthur, bend your arm down here, like that. Thats right, sir.

I slipped my hand into the crook of his arm.

He had to stoop a little to accommodate me, but if Miss Stephanie Crawford waswatching from her upstairs window, she would see Arthur Radley escorting me down thesidewalk, as any gentleman would do.

We came to the street light on the corner, and I wondered how many times Dill hadstood there hugging the fat pole, watching, waiting, hoping. I wondered how many timesJem and I had made this journey, but I entered the Radley front gate for the second timein my life. Boo and I walked up the steps to the porch. His fingers found the frontdoorknob. He gently released my hand, opened the door, went inside, and shut the doorbehind him. I never saw him again.

Neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between.

Boo was our neighbor. He gave us two soap dolls, a broken watch and chain, a pair ofgood-luck pennies, and our lives. But neighbors give in return. We never put back intothe tree what we took out of it: we had given him nothing, and it made me sad.

I turned to go home. Street lights winked down the street all the way to town. I hadnever seen our neighborhood from this angle. There were Miss Maudies, MissStephaniesthere was our house, I could see the porch swingMiss Rachels housewas beyond us, plainly visible. I could even see Mrs. Duboses.

I looked behind me. To the left of the brown door was a long shuttered window. Iwalked to it, stood in front of it, and turned around. In daylight, I thought, you could seeto the postoffice corner.

Daylight in my mind, the night faded. It was daytime and the neighborhood wasbusy. Miss Stephanie Crawford crossed the street to tell the latest to Miss Rachel. MissMaudie bent over her azaleas. It was summertime, and two children scampered downthe sidewalk toward a man approaching in the distance. The man waved, and thechildren raced each other to him.

It was still summertime, and the children came closer. A boy trudged down thesidewalk dragging a fishingpole behind him. A man stood waiting with his hands on hiships. Summertime, and his children played in the front yard with their friend, enacting astrange little drama of their own invention.

It was fall, and his children fought on the sidewalk in front of Mrs. Duboses. The boyhelped his sister to her feet, and they made their way home. Fall, and his children trottedto and fro around the corner, the days woes and triumphs on their faces. They stoppedat an oak tree, delighted, puzzled, apprehensive.

Winter, and his children shivered at the front gate, silhouetted against a blazing house.

Winter, and a man walked into the street, dropped his glasses, and shot a dog.

Summer, and he watched his childrens heart break. Autumn again, and Booschildren needed him.

Atticus was right. One time he said you never really know a man until you stand in hisshoes and walk around in them. Just standing on the Radley porch was enough.

The street lights were fuzzy from the fine rain that was falling. As I made my wayhome, I felt very old, but when I looked at the tip of my nose I could see fine mistybeads, but looking cross-eyed made me dizzy so I quit. As I made my way home, Ithought what a thing to tell Jem tomorrow. Hed be so mad he missed it he wouldntspeak to me for days. As I made my way home, I thought Jem and I would get grownbut there wasnt much else left for us to learn, except possibly algebra.

I ran up the steps and into the house. Aunt Alexandra had gone to bed, and Atticussroom was dark. I would see if Jem might be reviving. Atticus was in Jems room, sittingby his bed. He was reading a book.

Is Jem awake yet?

Sleeping peacefully. He wont be awake until morning.

Oh. Are you sittin up with him?

Just for an hour or so. Go to bed, Scout. Youve had a long day.

Well, I think Ill stay with you for a while.

Suit yourself, said Atticus. It must have been after midnight, and I was puzzled by hisamiable acquiescence. He was shrewder than I, however: the moment I sat down Ibegan to feel sleepy.

Whatcha readin? I asked.

Atticus turned the book over. Something of Jems. Called The Gray Ghost.

I was suddenly awake. Whyd you get that one?

Honey, I dont know. Just picked it up. One of the few things I havent read, he saidpointedly.

Read it out loud, please, Atticus. Its real scary.

No, he said. Youve had enough scaring for a while. This is too

Atticus, I wasnt scared.

He raised his eyebrows, and I protested: Leastways not till I started telling Mr. Tateabout it. Jem wasnt scared. Asked him and he said he wasnt. Besides, nothins realscary except in books.

Atticus opened his mouth to say something, but shut it again. He took his thumb fromthe middle of the book and turned back to the first page. I moved over and leaned myhead against his knee. Hrm, he said. The Gray Ghost, by Seckatary Hawkins.

Chapter One

I willed myself to stay awake, but the rain was so soft and the room was so warm andhis voice was so deep and his knee was so snug that I slept.

Seconds later, it seemed, his shoe was gently nudging my ribs. He lifted me to my feetand walked me to my room. Heard every word you said, I muttered. wasnt sleep atall, s about a ship an Three-Fingered Fred n Stoners Boy

He unhooked my overalls, leaned me against him, and pulled them off. He held me upwith one hand and reached for my pajamas with the other.

Yeah, an they all thought it was Stoners Boy messin up their clubhouse an throwin

ink all over it an

He guided me to the bed and sat me down. He lifted my legs and put me under thecover.

An they chased him n never could catch him cause they didnt know what he lookedlike, an Atticus, when they finally saw him, why he hadnt done any of those thingsAtticus, he was real nice

His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me.

Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.

He turned out the light and went into Jems room. He would be there all night, and hewould be there when Jem waked up in the morning.

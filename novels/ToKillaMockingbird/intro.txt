Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird, published in 1960, is a powerful novel about childhood, justice, and racial inequality in the American South. Narrated by Scout Finch, a young girl growing up in Alabama during the 1930s, the story follows her father, Atticus Finch, a principled lawyer who defends a Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Through Scout’s eyes, readers witness both the innocence of childhood and the harsh realities of prejudice and injustice. Blending warmth, humor, and moral courage, the novel remains a timeless exploration of empathy, fairness, and the struggle for human dignity.

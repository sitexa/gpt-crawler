Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights, published in 1847, is a dark and passionate tale of love, revenge, and fate set on the Yorkshire moors. The novel tells the turbulent story of Heathcliff, an orphan adopted into the Earnshaw family, and his intense, destructive bond with Catherine Earnshaw. Their love, marked by obsession and cruelty, defies social boundaries but brings suffering to themselves and those around them. Narrated through multiple perspectives, the novel explores themes of passion, class, inheritance, and the supernatural. With its gothic atmosphere and emotional intensity, Wuthering Heights remains one of the most haunting classics in English literature.
